the boats with his head they are propelled before him with vast swiftness and sometimes utterly destroyedIt is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting and in a commercial point of view so important an animal as the Sperm Whale should have been so entirely neglected or should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous and many of them competent observers that of late years must have possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes THOMAS BEALES HISTORY OF THE SPERM WHALE 1839  The Cachalot Sperm

particular to interest me on shore I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world  It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation  Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly November in my soul whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking peoples hats offthen I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can  This is my substitute for pistol and ball  With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword I quietly take to the ship  There is nothing surprising in this  If they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me  There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefscommerce surrounds it with her surf  Right and left the streets take you waterward  Its extreme downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooled by breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land  Look at the crowds of watergazers there  Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon  Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip and from thence by Whitehall northward  What do you seePosted like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries  Some leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pierheads some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China some high aloft in the rigging as if striving to get a still better seaward peep  But these are all landsmen of week days pent up in lath and plastertied to counters nailed to benches clinched to desks  How then is this  Are the green fields gone  What do they here  But look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a dive  Strange  Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice  No  They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in  And there they standmiles of themleagues  Inlanders all they come from lanes and alleys streets and avenuesnorth east south and west  Yet here they all unite  Tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither  Once more  Say you are in the country in some high land of lakes Take almost any path you please and ten to one it carries you down in a dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream  There is magic in it  Let the most absentminded of men be plunged in his deepest reveriesstand that man on his legs set his feet agoing and he will infallibly lead you to water if water there be in all that region  Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert try this experiment if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor  Yes as every one knows meditation and water are wedded for ever  But here is an artist  He desires to paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco  What is the chief element he employs  There stand his trees each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke  Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hillside blue  But though the picture lies thus tranced and though this pinetree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherds head yet all were vain unless the shepherds eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him  Go visit the Prairies in June when for scores on scores of miles you wade kneedeep among Tigerlilieswhat is the one charm wantingWaterthere is not a drop of water there  Were Niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to see it  Why did the poor poet of Tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach  Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea  Why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land  Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy  Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity and own brother of Jove  Surely all this is not without meaning  And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned  But that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans  It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all  Now when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of my lungs I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger  For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it  Besides passengers get seasickgrow quarrelsomedont sleep of nightsdo not enjoy themselves much as a general thingno I never go as a passenger nor though I am something of a salt do I ever go to sea as a Commodore or a Captain or a Cook  I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them  For my part I abominate all honourable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind whatsoever  It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself without taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not  And as for going as cookthough I confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of officer on shipboardyet somehow I never fancied broiling fowlsthough once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled fowl than I will  It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids  No when I go to sea I go as a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal masthead True they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a May meadow  And at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough  It touches ones sense of honour particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the Van Rensselaers or Randolphs or Hardicanutes  And more than all if just previous to putting your hand into the tarpot you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boys stand in awe of you  The transition is a keen one I assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it  But even this wears off in time  What of it if some old hunks of a seacaptain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks  What does that indignity amount to weighed I mean in the scales of the New Testament  Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance  Who aint a slave  Tell me that  Well then however the old seacaptains may order me abouthowever they may thump and punch me about I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same wayeither in a physical or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hands should rub each others shoulderblades and be content  Again I always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of  On the contrary passengers themselves must pay  And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid  The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us  But BEING PAIDwhat will compare with it  The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven  Ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition  Finally I always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck  For as in this world head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim so for the most part the Commodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle  He thinks he breathes it first but not so  In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it  But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of the Fates who has the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me in some unaccountable wayhe can better answer than any one else  And doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago  It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances  I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like thisGRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTANThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers the Fates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short and easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in farcesthough I cannot tell why this was exactly yet now that I recall all the circumstances I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises induced me to set about performing the part I did besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment  Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself  Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity  Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds helped to sway me to my wish  With other men perhaps such things would not have been inducements but as for me I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote  I love to sail forbidden seas and land on barbarous coasts  Not ignoring what is good I am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with itwould they let mesince it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in  By reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the great floodgates of the wonderworld swung open and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air CHAPTER 2  The CarpetBagI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpetbag tucked it under my arm and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific  Quitting the good city of old Manhatto I duly arrived in New Bedford  It was a Saturday night in December  Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place would offer till the following Monday  As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as well be related that I for one had no idea of so doing  For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft because there was a fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me  Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her yet Nantucket was her great originalthe Tyre of this Carthagethe place where the first dead American whale was stranded  Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen the RedMen first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan  And where but from Nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported cobblestonesso goes the storyto throw at the whales in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit  Now having a night a day and still another night following before me in New Bedford ere I could embark for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile  It was a very dubiouslooking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold and cheerless  I knew no one in the place  With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silverSo wherever you go Ishmael said I to myself as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear Ishmael be sure to inquire the price and dont be too particular  With halting steps I paced the streets and passed the sign of The Crossed Harpoonsbut it looked too expensive and jolly there Further on from the bright red windows of the SwordFish Inn there came such fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard asphaltic pavementrather weary for me when I struck my foot against the flinty projections because from hard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight  Too expensive and jolly again thought I pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within But go on Ishmael said I at last dont you hear get away from before the door your patched boots are stopping the way  So on I went  I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inns  Such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb  At this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted  But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly open  It had a careless look as if it were meant for the uses of the public so entering the first thing I did was to stumble over an ashbox in the porch  Ha thought I ha as the flying particles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city Gomorrah  But The Crossed Harpoons and The SwordFishthis then must needs be the sign of The Trap However I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interior door  It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet  A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit  It was a negro church and the preachers text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teethgnashing there  Ha Ishmael muttered I backing out Wretched entertainment at the sign of The Trap  Moving on I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words underneathThe Spouter InnPeter Coffin  CoffinSpouterRather ominous in that particular connexion thought I  But it is a common name in Nantucket they say and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there  As the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a povertystricken sort of creak to it I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee  It was a queer sort of placea gableended old house one side palsied as it were and leaning over sadly  It stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Pauls tossed craft  Euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one indoors with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed  In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon says an old writerof whose works I possess the only copy extantit maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both sides and of which the wight Death is the only glazier  True enough thought I as this passage occurred to my mindold blackletter thou reasonest well  Yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house  What a pity they didnt stop up the chinks and the crannies though and thrust in a little lint here and there  But its too late to make any improvements now  The universe is finished the copestone is on and the chips were carted off a million years ago Poor Lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings he might plug up both ears with rags and put a corncob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon  Euroclydon says old Dives in his red silken wrapperhe had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh  What a fine frosty night how Orion glitters what northern lights  Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals  But what thinks Lazarus  Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights  Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here  Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself in order to keep out this frost  Now that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas  Yet Dives himself he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans  But no more of this blubbering now we are going awhaling and there is plenty of that yet to come  Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet and see what sort of a place this Spouter may be CHAPTER 3  The SpouterInnEntering that gableended SpouterInn you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with oldfashioned wainscots reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft  On one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose  Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the New England hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched  But by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted  But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast  A boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted  Yet was there a sort of indefinite halfattained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant  Ever and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you throughIts the Black Sea in a midnight galeIts the unnatural combat of the four primal elementsIts a blasted heathIts a Hyperborean winter sceneIts the breakingup of the icebound stream of Time  But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the pictures midst  THAT once found out and all the rest were plain  But stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself  In fact the artists design seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject  The picture represents a CapeHorner in a great hurricane the halffoundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mastheads  The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears  Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knots of human hair and one was sickleshaped with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the newmown grass by a longarmed mower  You shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a deathharvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement  Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed  Some were storied weapons  With this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset  And that harpoonso like a corkscrew nowwas flung in Javan seas and run away with by a whale years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco  The original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the hump  Crossing this dusky entry and on through yon lowarched waycut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all roundyou enter the public room  A still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old crafts cockpits especially of such a howling night when this corneranchored old ark rocked so furiously  On one side stood a long low shelflike table covered with cracked glass cases filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide worlds remotest nooks Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a darklooking denthe bara rude attempt at a right whales head  Be that how it may there stands the vast arched bone of the whales jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it  Within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters bottles flasks and in those jaws of swift destruction like another cursed Jonah by which name indeed they called him bustles a little withered old man who for their money dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death  Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison  Though true cylinders withoutwithin the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom  Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpads goblets  Fill to THIS mark and your charge is but a penny to THIS a penny more and so on to the full glassthe Cape Horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling  Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table examining by a dim light divers specimens of SKRIMSHANDER  I sought the landlord and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house was fullnot a bed unoccupied  But avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneers blanket have ye  I spose you are goin awhalin so youd better get used to that sort of thing  I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed that if I should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night I would put up with the half of any decent mans blanket  I thought so  All right take a seat  Supperyou want supper Supperll be ready directly  I sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the Battery  At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jackknife stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs  He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail but he didnt make much headway I thought  At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room  It was cold as Icelandno fire at allthe landlord said he couldnt afford it  Nothing but two dismal tallow candles each in a winding sheet  We were fain to button up our monkey jackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers  But the fare was of the most substantial kindnot only meat and potatoes but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper  One young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner  My boy said the landlord youll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty  Landlord I whispered that aint the harpooneer is it  Oh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap  He never eats dumplings he donthe eats nothing but steaks and he likes em rare  The devil he does says I  Where is that harpooneer  Is he here  Hell be here afore long was the answer  I could not help it but I began to feel suspicious of this dark complexioned harpooneer  At any rate I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before I did  Supper over the company went back to the barroom when knowing not what else to do with myself I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on  Presently a rioting noise was heard without  Starting up the landlord cried Thats the Grampuss crew  I seed her reported in the offing this morning a three years voyage and a full ship Hurrah boys now well have the latest news from the Feegees  A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough  Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador  They had just landed from their boat and this was the first house they entered  No wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whales mouththe barwhen the wrinkled little old Jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round  One complained of a bad cold in his head upon which Jonah mixed him a pitchlike potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of Labrador or on the weather side of an iceisland  The liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they began capering about most obstreperously  I observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest  This man interested me at once and since the seagods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleepingpartner one so far as this narrative is concerned I will here venture upon a little description of him  He stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a cofferdam  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man  His face was deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy  His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner and from his fine stature I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia  When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height this man slipped away unobserved and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea  In a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised a cry of Bulkington  Bulkington wheres Bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of him  It was now about nine oclock and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen  No man prefers to sleep two in a bed  In fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother  I dont know how it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping  And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely multiply  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor Kings do ashore  To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin  The more I pondered over this harpooneer the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him  It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of the tidiest certainly none of the finest  I began to twitch all over  Besides it was getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards  Suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnighthow could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming  Landlord  Ive changed my mind about that harpooneerI shant sleep with him  Ill try the bench here  Just as you please Im sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and its a plaguy rough board herefeeling of the knots and notches  But wait a bit Skrimshander Ive got a carpenters plane there in the barwait I say and Ill make ye snug enough So saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning like an ape  The shavings flew right and left till at last the planeiron came bump against an indestructible knot The landlord was near spraining his wrist and I told him for heavens sake to quitthe bed was soft enough to suit me and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank  So gathering up the shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study  I now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair  But it was a foot too narrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed oneso there was no yoking them  I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night  The devil fetch that harpooneer thought I but stop couldnt I steal a march on himbolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be wakened by the most violent knockings  It seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts I dismissed it  For who could tell but what the next morning so soon as I popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down  Still looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other persons bed I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer  Thinks I Ill wait awhile he must be dropping in before long  Ill have a good look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after alltheres no telling  But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer  Landlord said I what sort of a chap is hedoes he always keep such late hours  It was now hard upon twelve oclock  The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension  No he answered generally hes an early birdairley to bed and airley to riseyes hes the bird what catches the worm  But tonight he went out a peddling you see and I dont see what on airth keeps him so late unless may be he cant sell his head  Cant sell his headWhat sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me getting into a towering rage  Do you pretend to say landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night or rather Sunday morning in peddling his head around this town  Thats precisely it said the landlord and I told him he couldnt sell it here the markets overstocked  With what shouted I  With heads to be sure aint there too many heads in the world  I tell you what it is landlord said I quite calmly youd better stop spinning that yarn to meIm not green  May be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but I rayther guess youll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin his head  Ill break it for him said I now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlords  Its broke aready said he  Broke said IBROKE do you mean  Sartain and thats the very reason he cant sell it I guess  Landlord said I going up to him as cool as Mt Hecla in a snowstormlandlord stop whittling  You and I must understand one another and that too without delay  I come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer  And about this harpooneer whom I have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him  And in the first place you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and Ive no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir YOU I mean landlord YOU sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution  Wall said the landlord fetching a long breath thats a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then  But be easy be easy this here harpooneer I have been tellin you of has just arrived from the south seas where he bought up a lot of balmed New Zealand heads great curios you know and hes sold all on em but one and that one hes trying to sell tonight cause tomorrows Sunday and it would not do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks is goin to churches  He wanted to last Sunday but I stopped him just as he was goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the airth like a string of inions  This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling mebut at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators  Depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man  He pays reglar was the rejoinder  But come its getting dreadful late you had better be turning flukesits a nice bed Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced  Theres plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed its an almighty big bed that  Why afore we give it up Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it  But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow Sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm  Arter that Sal said it wouldnt do  Come along here Ill give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me offering to lead the way  But I stood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimed I vum its Sundayyou wont see that harpooneer tonight hes come to anchor somewherecome along then DO come WONT ye come  I considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and I was ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast  There said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a washstand and centre table there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye  I turned round from eyeing the bed but he had disappeared  Folding back the counterpane I stooped over the bed  Though none of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well  I then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale  Of things not properly belonging to the room there was a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seamans bag containing the harpooneers wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk  Likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fireplace and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed  But what is this on the chest  I took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it  I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin  There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat as you see the same in South American ponchos  But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise I put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and I thought a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day  I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and I never saw such a sight in my life  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck  I sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this headpeddling harpooneer and his door mat  After thinking some time on the bedside I got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking  I then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves  But beginning to feel very cold now half undressed as I was and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneers not coming home at all that night it being so very late I made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care of heaven  Whether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery there is no telling but I rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time  At last I slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door  Lord save me thinks I that must be the harpooneer the infernal headpeddler  But I lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to  Holding a light in one hand and that identical New Zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room  I was all eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bags mouth  This accomplished however he turned roundwhen good heavens what a sight  Such a face  It was of a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares  Yes its just as I thought hes a terrible bedfellow hes been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon  But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that I plainly saw they could not be stickingplasters at all those black squares on his cheeks  They were stains of some sort or other  At first I knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me  I remembered a story of a white mana whaleman toowho falling among the cannibals had been tattooed by them  I concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure  And what is it thought I after all  Its only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin  But then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it I mean lying round about and completely independent of the squares of tattooing  To be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but I never heard of a hot suns tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one However I had never been in the South Seas and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin  Now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me at all  But after some difficulty having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a sealskin wallet with the hair on  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the New Zealand heada ghastly thing enoughand crammed it down into the bag  He now took off his hata new beaver hatwhen I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise  There was no hair on his headnone to speak of at leastnothing but a small scalpknot twisted up on his forehead  His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull  Had not the stranger stood between me and the door I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner  Even as it was I thought something of slipping out of the window but it was the second floor back  I am no coward but what to make of this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension  Ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night  In fact I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him  Meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed his chest and arms  As I live these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years War and just escaped from it with a stickingplaster shirt Still more his very legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms  It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas and so landed in this Christian country  I quaked to think of it  A peddler of heads tooperhaps the heads of his own brothers  He might take a fancy to mineheavens look at that tomahawk  But there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen  Going to his heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three days old Congo baby  Remembering the embalmed head at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner  But seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be  For now the savage goes up to the empty fireplace and removing the papered fireboard sets up this little hunchbacked image like a tenpin between the andirons  The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that I thought this fireplace made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol  I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease meantimeto see what was next to follow  First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze  Presently after many hasty snatches into the fire and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ashes a little he made a polite offer of it to the little negro  But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips  All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a singsong or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner At last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock  All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations and jumping into bed with me I thought it was high time now or never before the light was put out to break the spell in which I had so long been bound  But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one  Taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke  The next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me  I sang out I could not help it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me  Stammering out something I knew not what I rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again  But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning  Whoe debel youhe at last saidyou no speake damme I kille  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark  Landlord for Gods sake Peter Coffin shouted I  Landlord Watch  Coffin  Angels save me  Speake tellee me whoee be or damme I kille again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire  But thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand and leaping from the bed I ran up to him  Dont be afraid now said he grinning again Queequeg here wouldnt harm a hair of your head  Stop your grinning shouted I and why didnt you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal  I thought ye knowd itdidnt I tell ye he was a peddlin heads around townbut turn flukes again and go to sleep  Queequeg look hereyou sabbee me I sabbeeyou this man sleepe youyou sabbee  Me sabbee plentygrunted Queequeg puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed  You gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side  He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way  I stood looking at him a moment  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal  Whats all this fuss I have been making about thought I to myselfthe mans a human being just as I am he has just as much reason to fear me as I have to be afraid of him Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian  Landlord said I tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and I will turn in with him  But I dont fancy having a man smoking in bed with me  Its dangerous  Besides I aint insured  This being told to Queequeg he at once complied and again politely motioned me to get into bedrolling over to one side as much as to sayI wont touch a leg of ye  Good night landlord said I you may go  I turned in and never slept better in my life CHAPTER 4  The CounterpaneUpon waking next morning about daylight I found Queequegs arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner  You had almost thought I had been his wife  The counterpane was of patchwork full of odd little particoloured squares and triangles and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure no two parts of which were of one precise shadeowing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various timesthis same arm of his I say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt  Indeed partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke I could hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hues together and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me  My sensations were strange  Let me try to explain them  When I was a child I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it was a reality or a dream I never could entirely settle  The circumstance was this  I had been cutting up some caper or otherI think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other was all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperlessmy mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed though it was only two oclock in the afternoon of the 21st June the longest day in the year in our hemisphere  I felt dreadfully  But there was no help for it so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets  I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection  Sixteen hours in bed the small of my back ached to think of it  And it was so light too the sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches in the streets and the sound of gay voices all over the house  I felt worse and worseat last I got up dressed and softly going down in my stockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself at her feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time  But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers and back I had to go to my room  For several hours I lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes  At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from ithalf steeped in dreamsI opened my eyes and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame nothing was to be seen and nothing was to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine  My arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my bedside For what seemed ages piled on ages I lay there frozen with the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning I shudderingly remembered it all and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery  Nay to this very hour I often puzzle myself with it  Now take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequegs pagan arm thrown round me  But at length all the past nights events soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament  For though I tried to move his armunlock his bridegroom claspyet sleeping as he was he still hugged me tightly as though naught but death should part us twain I now strove to rouse himQueequegbut his only answer was a snore  I then rolled over my neck feeling as if it were in a horsecollar and suddenly felt a slight scratch  Throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savages side as if it were a hatchetfaced baby  A pretty pickle truly thought I abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk  Queequegin the name of goodness Queequeg wake  At length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style I succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff as a pikestaff looking at me and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him  Meanwhile I lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature  When at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow and he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself  Thinks I Queequeg under the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are  I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg because he treated me with so much civility and consideration while I was guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding  Nevertheless a man like Queequeg you dont see every day he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding  He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and thenstill minus his trowsershe hunted up his boots  What under the heavens he did it for I cannot tell but his next movement was to crush himselfboots in hand and hat onunder the bed when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings I inferred he was hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his boots  But Queequeg do you see was a creature in the transition stageneither caterpillar nor butterfly  He was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners  His education was not yet completed  He was an undergraduate  If he had not been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on  At last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if not being much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide onesprobably not made to order eitherrather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning  Seeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that the street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boots on I begged him as well as I could to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible  He complied and then proceeded to wash himself  At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face but Queequeg to my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest arms and hands  He then donned his waistcoat and taking up a piece of hard soap on the washstand centre table dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face I was watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed corner slips out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begins a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheeks  Thinks I Queequeg this is using Rogerss best cutlery with a vengeance  Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept  The rest of his toilet was soon achieved and he proudly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his harpoon like a marshals baton CHAPTER 5  BreakfastI quickly followed suit and descending into the barroom accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly  I cherished no malice towards him though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow  However a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the mores the pity  So if any one man in his own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way  And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for  The barroom was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous and whom I had not as yet had a good look at They were nearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates and third mates and sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and harpooneers and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky beards an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns  You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore This young fellows healthy cheek is like a suntoasted pear in hue and would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage  That man next him looks a few shades lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him  In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore  But who could show a cheek like Queequeg which barred with various tints seemed like the Andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climates zone by zone  Grub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went to breakfast  They say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease in manner quite selfpossessed in company  Not always though Ledyard the great New England traveller and Mungo Park the Scotch one of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of Africa which was the sum of poor Mungos performancesthis kind of travel I say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish  Still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere  These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence  And not only that but they looked embarrassed  Yes here were a set of seadogs many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seasentire strangers to themand duelled them dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast tableall of the same calling all of kindred tasteslooking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains  A curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen  But as for Queequegwhy Queequeg sat there among themat the head of the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle  To be sure I cannot say much for his breeding  His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many heads and grappling the beefsteaks towards him  But THAT was certainly very coolly done by him and every one knows that in most peoples estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly  We will not speak of all Queequegs peculiarities here how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks done rare  Enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawkpipe and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when I sallied out for a stroll CHAPTER 6  The StreetIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford  In thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts  Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies  Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays and at Bombay in the Apollo Green live Yankees have often scared the natives  But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping  In these lastmentioned haunts you see only sailors but in New Bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners savages outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh  It makes a stranger stare  But besides the Feegeeans Tongatobooarrs Erromanggoans Pannangians and Brighggians and besides the wild specimens of the whalingcraft which unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights still more curious certainly more comical  There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery  They are mostly young of stalwart frames fellows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whalelance Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came  In some things you would think them but a few hours old  Look there that chap strutting round the corner  He wears a beaver hat and swallowtailed coat girdled with a sailorbelt and sheathknife Here comes another with a souwester and a bombazine cloak  No townbred dandy will compare with a countrybred oneI mean a downright bumpkin dandya fellow that in the dogdays will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands  Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and joins the great whalefishery you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport  In bespeaking his seaoutfit he orders bellbuttons to his waistcoats straps to his canvas trowsers  Ah poor HaySeed how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale when thou art driven straps buttons and all down the throat of the tempest  But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibals and bumpkins to show her visitors  Not at all  Still New Bedford is a queer place  Had it not been for us whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador  As it is parts of her back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony  The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all New England  It is a land of oil true enough but not like Canaan a land also of corn and wine The streets do not run with milk nor in the springtime do they pave them with fresh eggs  Yet in spite of this nowhere in all America will you find more patricianlike houses parks and gardens more opulent than in New Bedford  Whence came they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country  Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion and your question will be answered  Yes all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic Pacific and Indian oceans  One and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea  Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that  In New Bedford fathers they say give whales for dowers to their daughters and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises apiece You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles  In summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine mapleslong avenues of green and gold  And in August high in air the beautiful and bountiful horsechestnuts candelabrawise proffer the passerby their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms  So omnipotent is art which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creations final day  And the women of New Bedford they bloom like their own red roses But roses only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens  Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye cannot save in Salem where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands CHAPTER 7  The ChapelIn this same New Bedford there stands a Whalemans Chapel and few are the moody fishermen shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot  I am sure that I did not  Returning from my first morning stroll I again sallied out upon this special errand  The sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving sleet and mist  Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin I fought my way against the stubborn storm Entering I found a small scattered congregation of sailors and sailors wives and widows  A muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm  Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable  The chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets with black borders masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit  Three of them ran something like the following but I do not pretend to quote  SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT Who at the age of eighteen was lost overboard Near the Isle of Desolation off Patagonia November 1st 1836 THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTERSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG WILLIS ELLERY NATHAN COLEMAN WALTER CANNY SETH MACY AND SAMUEL GLEIG Forming one of the boats crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale On the Offshore Ground in the PACIFIC December 31st 1839 THIS MARBLE Is here placed by their surviving SHIPMATESSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan AUGUST 3d 1833 THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW  Shaking off the sleet from my iceglazed hat and jacket I seated myself near the door and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me  Affected by the solemnity of the scene there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance  This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance because he was the only one who could not read and therefore was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall  Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation I knew not but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh  Oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among flowers can sayhere HERE lies my beloved ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these  What bitter blanks in those blackbordered marbles which cover no ashes  What despair in those immovable inscriptions  What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave  As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here  In what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included why it is that a universal proverb says of them that they tell no tales though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world we prefix so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle him if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth why the Life Insurance Companies pay deathforfeitures upon immortals in what eternal unstirring paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all the dead wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city  All these things are not without their meanings  But Faith like a jackal feeds among the tombs and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope  It needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a Nantucket voyage I regarded those marble tablets and by the murky light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me  Yes Ishmael the same fate may be thine  But somehow I grew merry again  Delightful inducements to embark fine chance for promotion it seemsaye a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet  Yes there is death in this business of whalinga speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity  But what then  Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death  Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance  Methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being  In fact take my body who will take it I say it is not me  And therefore three cheers for Nantucket and come a stove boat and stove body when they will for stave my soul Jove himself cannot CHAPTER 8  The PulpitI had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered immediately as the stormpelted door flew back upon admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain  Yes it was the famous Father Mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he was a very great favourite  He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry  At the time I now write of Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth for among all the fissures of his wrinkles there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloomthe spring verdure peeping forth even beneath Februarys snow  No one having previously heard his history could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed  However hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpit  Like most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and since a regular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with the floor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect it seemed had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple and finished the pulpit without a stairs substituting a perpendicular side ladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted manropes for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad taste  Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the manropes Father Mapple cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailorlike but still reverential dexterity hand over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the maintop of his vessel  The perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case with swinging ones were of clothcovered rope only the rounds were of wood so that at every step there was a joint  At my first glimpse of the pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height slowly turn round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder step by step till the whole was deposited within leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec  I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage  No thought I there must be some sober reason for this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen  Can it be then that by that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly ties and connexions  Yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful man of God this pulpit I see is a selfcontaining strongholda lofty Ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls  But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place borrowed from the chaplains former seafarings  Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers  But high above the flying scud and darkrolling clouds there floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angels face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ships tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victorys plank where Nelson fell  Ah noble ship the angel seemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling offserenest azure is at hand  Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same seataste that had achieved the ladder and the picture  Its panelled front was in the likeness of a ships bluff bows and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ships fiddleheaded beak  What could be more full of meaningfor the pulpit is ever this earths foremost part all the rest comes in its rear the pulpit leads the world  From thence it is the storm of Gods quick wrath is first descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt  From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds  Yes the worlds a ship on its passage out and not a voyage complete and the pulpit is its prow CHAPTER 9  The SermonFather Mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense  Starboard gangway there side away to larboardlarboard gangway to starboard Midships midships  There was a low rumbling of heavy seaboots among the benches and a still slighter shuffling of womens shoes and all was quiet again and every eye on the preacher  He paused a little then kneeling in the pulpits bows folded his large brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea  This ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fogin such tones he commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy  The ribs and terrors in the whale Arched over me a dismal gloom While all Gods sunlit waves rolled by And lift me deepening down to doom  I saw the opening maw of hell With endless pains and sorrows there Which none but they that feel can tell Oh I was plunging to despair  In black distress I called my God When I could scarce believe him mine He bowed his ear to my complaints No more the whale did me confine  With speed he flew to my relief As on a radiant dolphin borne Awful yet bright as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God  My song for ever shall record That terrible that joyful hour I give the glory to my God His all the mercy and the powerNearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the howling of the storm  A brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible and at last folding his hand down upon the proper page said Beloved shipmates clinch the last verse of the first chapter of JonahAnd God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah  Shipmates this book containing only four chaptersfour yarnsis one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures Yet what depths of the soul does Jonahs deep sealine sound what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet  What a noble thing is that canticle in the fishs belly  How billowlike and boisterously grand  We feel the floods surging over us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us  But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches Shipmates it is a twostranded lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God  As sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it is a story of the sin hardheartedness suddenly awakened fears the swift punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah As with all sinners among men the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of Godnever mind now what that command was or how conveyedwhich he found a hard command But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to doremember thatand hence he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade  And if we obey God we must disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying God consists  With this sin of disobedience in him Jonah still further flouts at God by seeking to flee from Him  He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where God does not reign but only the Captains of this earth  He skulks about the wharves of Joppa and seeks a ship thats bound for Tarshish  There lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded meaning here  By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz  Thats the opinion of learned men  And where is Cadiz shipmates  Cadiz is in Spain as far by water from Joppa as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea Because Joppa the modern Jaffa shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean the Syrian and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that just outside the Straits of Gibraltar  See ye not then shipmates that Jonah sought to flee worldwide from God  Miserable man  Oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his God prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas  So disordered selfcondemning is his look that had there been policemen in those days Jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck  How plainly hes a fugitive no baggage not a hatbox valise or carpetbagno friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux  At last after much dodging search he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the strangers evil eye  Jonah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence in vain essays his wretched smile  Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent  In their gamesome but still serious way one whispers to the otherJack hes robbed a widow or Joe do you mark him hes a bigamist or Harry lad I guess hes the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah or belike one of the missing murderers from Sodom  Another runs to read the bill thats stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide and containing a description of his person  He reads and looks from Jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah prepared to lay their hands upon him  Frighted Jonah trembles and summoning all his boldness to his face only looks so much the more a coward  He will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicion So he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised they let him pass and he descends into the cabin  Whos there cries the Captain at his busy desk hurriedly making out his papers for the CustomsWhos there  Oh how that harmless question mangles Jonah  For the instant he almost turns to flee again  But he rallies  I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish how soon sail ye sir  Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah though the man now stands before him but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance  We sail with the next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing him  No sooner sirSoon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger  Ha  Jonah thats another stab  But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent  Ill sail with yehe saysthe passage money how much is thatIll pay now For it is particularly written shipmates as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail  And taken with the context this is full of meaning  Now Jonahs Captain shipmates was one whose discernment detects crime in any but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless In this world shipmates sin that pays its way can travel freely and without a passport whereas Virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers  So Jonahs Captain prepares to test the length of Jonahs purse ere he judge him openly  He charges him thrice the usual sum and its assented to  Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold  Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions still molest the Captain  He rings every coin to find a counterfeit  Not a forger any way he mutters and Jonah is put down for his passage  Point out my stateroom Sir says Jonah now Im travelweary I need sleep  Thou lookest like it says the Captain theres thy room  Jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key  Hearing him foolishly fumbling there the Captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters something about the doors of convicts cells being never allowed to be locked within  All dressed and dusty as he is Jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the little stateroom ceiling almost resting on his forehead  The air is close and Jonah gasps  Then in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ships waterline Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels wards  Screwed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonahs room and the ship heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame and all though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it but made obvious the false lying levels among which it hung  The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance  But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him  The floor the ceiling and the side are all awry  Oh so my conscience hangs in me he groans straight upwards so it burns but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness  Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of the Roman racehorse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and theres naught to staunch it so after sore wrestlings in his berth Jonahs prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep  And now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish all careening glides to sea  That ship my friends was the first of recorded smugglers the contraband was Jonah  But the sea rebels he will not bear the wicked burden  A dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to break  But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her when boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonahs head in all this raging tumult Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep  He sees no black sky and raging sea feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him  Aye shipmates Jonah was gone down into the sides of the shipa berth in the cabin as I have taken it and was fast asleep  But the frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear What meanest thou O sleeper arise Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry Jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the deck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea  But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks  Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat  And ever as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep  Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul  In all his cringing attitudes the Godfugitive is now too plainly known  The sailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high Heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them  The lot is Jonahs that discovered then how furiously they mob him with their questions What is thine occupation  Whence comest thou  Thy country  What people  But mark now my shipmates the behavior of poor Jonah  The eager mariners but ask him who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer to those questions but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him  I am a Hebrew he criesand thenI fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land  Fear him O Jonah Aye well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN  Straightway he now goes on to make a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled but still are pitiful  For when Jonah not yet supplicating God for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his desertswhen wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea for he knew that for HIS sake this great tempest was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship  But all in vain the indignant gale howls louder then with one hand raised invokingly to God with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah  And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the sea is still as Jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth water behind  He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shootsto all his ivory teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison  Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fishs belly  But observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson  For sinful as he is Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance  He feels that his dreadful punishment is just  He leaves all his deliverance to God contenting himself with this that spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards His holy temple  And here shipmates is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment  And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale Shipmates I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance  Sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like Jonah  While he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing Jonahs seastorm seemed tossed by a storm himself His deep chest heaved as with a groundswell his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them  There now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the leaves of the Book once more and at last standing motionless with closed eyes for the moment seemed communing with God and himself  But again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowly with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake these words  Shipmates God has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press upon me  I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me for I am a greater sinner than ye  And now how gladly would I come down from this masthead and sit on the hatches there where you sit and listen as you listen while some one of you reads ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME as a pilot of the living God  How being an anointed pilotprophet or speaker of true things and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh Jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa  But God is everywhere Tarshish he never reached  As we have seen God came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along into the midst of the seas where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down and the weeds were wrapped about his head and all the watery world of woe bowled over him  Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummetout of the belly of hellwhen the whale grounded upon the oceans utmost bones even then God heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried  Then God spake unto the fish and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights of air and earth and vomited out Jonah upon the dry land when the word of the Lord came a second time and Jonah bruised and beatenhis ears like two seashells still multitudinously murmuring of the oceanJonah did the Almightys bidding  And what was that shipmates  To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood  That was it  This shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it  Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty  Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale  Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal  Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness  Woe to him who in this world courts not dishonour  Woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were salvation Yea woe to him who as the great Pilot Paul has it while preaching to others is himself a castaway  He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasmBut oh shipmates on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep  Is not the maintruck higher than the kelson is low  Delight is to hima far far upward and inward delightwho against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him  Delight is to him who gives no quarter in the truth and kills burns and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges  Delighttopgallant delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the Lord his God and is only a patriot to heaven  Delight is to him whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages  And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his final breathO Fatherchiefly known to me by Thy rodmortal or immortal here I die  I have striven to be Thine more than to be this worlds or mine own  Yet this is nothing I leave eternity to Thee for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God  He said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face with his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and he was left alone in the place CHAPTER 10  A Bosom FriendReturning to the SpouterInn from the Chapel I found Queequeg there quite alone he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time  He was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet on the stove hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with a jackknife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way  But being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth pageas I fanciedstopping a moment looking vacantly around him and giving utterance to a longdrawn gurgling whistle of astonishment  He would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited  With much interest I sat watching him  Savage though he was and hideously marred about the faceat least to my tastehis countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable  You cannot hide the soul  Through all his unearthly tattooings I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils  And besides all this there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim  He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor  Whether it was too that his head being shaved his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansive than it otherwise would this I will not venture to decide but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one  It may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of General Washingtons head as seen in the popular busts of him  It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows which were likewise very projecting like two long promontories thickly wooded on top  Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed  Whilst I was thus closely scanning him halfpretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book  Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning I thought this indifference of his very strange  But savages are strange beings at times you do not know exactly how to take them  At first they are overawing their calm selfcollectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom  I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the other seamen in the inn  He made no advances whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances  All this struck me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there was something almost sublime in it Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home by the way of Cape Horn that iswhich was the only way he could get therethrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to himself  Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that  But perhaps to be true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving  So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher I conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he must have broken his digester  As I sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that mild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then only glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swells I began to be sensible of strange feelings  I felt a melting in me  No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world  This soothing savage had redeemed it  There he sat his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits  Wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him And those same things that would have repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me  Ill try a pagan friend thought I since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy  I drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs and hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile  At first he little noticed these advances but presently upon my referring to his last nights hospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows  I told him yes whereat I thought he looked pleased perhaps a little complimented  We then turned over the book together and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it  Thus I soon engaged his interest and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town  Soon I proposed a social smoke and producing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff  And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly passing between us  If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagans breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left us cronies  He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his forehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were married meaning in his countrys phrase that we were bosom friends he would gladly die for me if need should be In a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply  After supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room together  He made me a present of his embalmed head took out his enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some thirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of them towards me and said it was mine  I was going to remonstrate but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pockets  I let them stay  He then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed the paper fireboard  By certain signs and symptoms I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him but well knowing what was to follow I deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me I would comply or otherwise  I was a good Christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church  How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood  But what is worship thought I Do you suppose now Ishmael that the magnanimous God of heaven and earthpagans and all includedcan possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood  Impossible  But what is worshipto do the will of GodTHAT is worship  And what is the will of Godto do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to meTHAT is the will of God  Now Queequeg is my fellow man  And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me  Why unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship Consequently I must then unite with him in his ergo I must turn idolator  So I kindled the shavings helped prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences and all the world But we did not go to sleep without some little chat  How it is I know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends  Man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning  Thus then in our hearts honeymoon lay I and Queequega cosy loving pair CHAPTER 11  NightgownWe had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free and easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulations what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed and we felt like getting up again though daybreak was yet some way down the future  Yes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against the headboard with our four knees drawn up close together and our two noses bending over them as if our kneepans were warmingpans  We felt very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors indeed out of bedclothes too seeing that there was no fire in the room  The more so I say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast  Nothing exists in itself  If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more  But if like Queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm  For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich  For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air  Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal  We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at once I thought I would open my eyes for when between sheets whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed  Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences though light be more congenial to our clayey part  Upon opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasant and selfcreated darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelveoclockatnight I experienced a disagreeable revulsion  Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk  Be it said that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them  For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then  I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlords policy of insurance  I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend  With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flame of the newlit lamp  Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes I know not but he now spoke of his native island and eager to hear his history I begged him to go on and tell it  He gladly complied  Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words yet subsequent disclosures when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give CHAPTER 12  BiographicalQueequeg was a native of Rokovoko an island far away to the West and South  It is not down in any map true places never are  When a newhatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green sapling even then in Queequegs ambitious soul lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two  His father was a High Chief a King his uncle a High Priest and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors  There was excellent blood in his veinsroyal stuff though sadly vitiated I fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth  A Sag Harbor ship visited his fathers bay and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands  But the ship having her full complement of seamen spurned his suit and not all the King his fathers influence could prevail  But Queequeg vowed a vow  Alone in his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island  On one side was a coral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water  Hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with its prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chains and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled a ringbolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces  In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists Queequeg was the son of a King and Queequeg budged not  Struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild desire to visit Christendom the captain at last relented and told him he might make himself at home  But this fine young savagethis sea Prince of Wales never saw the Captains cabin They put him down among the sailors and made a whaleman of him  But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen  For at bottomso he told mehe was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they were  But alas the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his fathers heathens  Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on to Nantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also poor Queequeg gave it up for lost  Thought he its a wicked world in all meridians Ill die a pagan  And thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these Christians wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish Hence the queer ways about him though now some time from home  By hints I asked him whether he did not propose going back and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he being very old and feeble at the last accounts  He answered no not yet and added that he was fearful Christianity or rather Christians had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him  But by and by he said he would returnas soon as he felt himself baptized again  For the nonce however he proposed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans  They had made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now  I asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future movements  He answered to go to sea again in his old vocation Upon this I told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from  He at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds  To all this I joyously assented for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such could not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted with the sea as known to merchant seamen  His story being ended with his pipes last dying puff Queequeg embraced me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were sleepingCHAPTER 13  WheelbarrowNext morning Monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block I settled my own and comrades bill using however my comrades money  The grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequegespecially as Peter Coffins cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied with  We borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own poor carpetbag and Queequegs canvas sack and hammock away we went down to the Moss the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf  As we were going along the people stared not at Queequeg so muchfor they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streetsbut at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms  But we heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs  I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons  To this in substance he replied that though what I hinted was true enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales  In short like many inland reapers and mowers who go into the farmers meadows armed with their own scythesthough in no wise obliged to furnish themeven so Queequeg for his own private reasons preferred his own harpoon  Shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen  It was in Sag Harbor The owners of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house  Not to seem ignorant about the thingthough in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrowQueequeg puts his chest upon it lashes it fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf  Why said I Queequeg you might have known better than that one would think  Didnt the people laugh  Upon this he told me another story  The people of his island of Rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held  Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko and its commanderfrom all accounts a very stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captainthis commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequegs sister a pretty young princess just turned of ten  Well when all the wedding guests were assembled at the brides bamboo cottage this Captain marches in and being assigned the post of honour placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the High Priest and his majesty the King Queequegs father  Grace being saidfor those people have their grace as well as wethough Queequeg told me that unlike us who at such times look downwards to our platters they on the contrary copying the ducks glance upwards to the great Giver of all feastsGrace I say being said the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates  Seeing himself placed next the Priest and noting the ceremony and thinking himselfbeing Captain of a shipas having plain precedence over a mere island King especially in the Kings own housethe Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowltaking it I suppose for a huge fingerglass  Now said Queequeg what you tink nowDidnt our people laugh  At last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner  Hoisting sail it glided down the Acushnet river  On one side New Bedford rose in terraces of streets their icecovered trees all glittering in the clear cold air  Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the worldwandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruises were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begins a second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for ever and for aye  Such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all earthly effort  Gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings  How I snuffed that Tartar airhow I spurned that turnpike earththat common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records  At the same foamfountain Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me His dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth  On on we flew and our offing gained the Moss did homage to the blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan Sideways leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes  So full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers a lubberlike assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro  But there were some boobies and bumpkins there who by their intense greenness must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back  I thought the bumpkins hour of doom was come  Dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern in midsomerset the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet while Queequeg turning his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff  Capting  Capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer Capting Capting heres the devil  Hallo YOU sir cried the Captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking up to Queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that  Dont you know you might have killed that chap  What him say said Queequeg as he mildly turned to me  He say said I that you came near kille that man there pointing to the still shivering greenhorn  Kille cried Queequeg twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain ah him bevy smalle fishe Queequeg no kille so smalle fishe Queequeg kille big whale  Look you roared the Captain Ill kille YOU you cannibal if you try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye  But it so happened just then that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye  The prodigious strain upon the mainsail had parted the weathersheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all hands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness  It flew from right to left and back again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters  Nothing was done and nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale  In the midst of this consternation Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwarks and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe  The schooner was run into the wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat Queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam  I looked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved  The greenhorn had gone down  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water Queequeg now took an instants glance around him and seeming to see just how matters were dived down and disappeared  A few minutes more and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form  The boat soon picked them up  The poor bumpkin was restored  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon  From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle yea till poor Queequeg took his last long dive  Was there ever such unconsciousness  He did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies He only asked for waterfresh watersomething to wipe the brine off that done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying to himselfIts a mutual jointstock world in all meridians  We cannibals must help these Christians CHAPTER 14  NantucketNothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a fine run we safely arrived in Nantucket  Nantucket  Take out your map and look at it  See what a real corner of the world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse  Look at ita mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background  There is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper  Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they dont grow naturally that they import Canada thistles that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome that people there plant toadstools before their houses to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass makes an oasis three blades in a days walk a prairie that they wear quicksand shoes something like Laplander snowshoes that they are so shut up belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island of by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles  But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois  Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the redmen  Thus goes the legend  In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast and carried off an infant Indian in his talons  With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters  They resolved to follow in the same direction  Setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casketthe poor little Indians skeleton  What wonder then that these Nantucketers born on a beach should take to the sea for a livelihood  They first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets for mackerel more experienced they pushed off in boats and captured cod and at last launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored this watery world put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in at Behrings Straits and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood most monstrous and most mountainous  That Himmalehan saltsea Mastodon clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults  And thus have these naked Nantucketers these sea hermits issuing from their anthill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders parcelling out among them the Atlantic Pacific and Indian oceans as the three pirate powers did Poland  Let America add Mexico to Texas and pile Cuba upon Canada let the English overswarm all India and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketers  For the sea is his he owns it as Emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of way through it  Merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but floating forts even pirates and privateers though following the sea as highwaymen the road they but plunder other ships other fragments of the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself  The Nantucketer he alone resides and riots on the sea he alone in Bible language goes down to it in ships to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation  THERE is his home THERE lies his business which a Noahs flood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millions in China  He lives on the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps  For years he knows not the land so that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman  With the landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows so at nightfall the Nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales CHAPTER 15  ChowderIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor and Queequeg and I went ashore so we could attend to no business that day at least none but a supper and a bed  The landlord of the SpouterInn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders In short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try potluck at the Try Pots  But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard and that done then ask the first man we met where the place was these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first especially as at the outset Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouseour first point of departuremust be left on the larboard hand whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard However by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which there was no mistaking  Two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses ears swung from the crosstrees of an old topmast planted in front of an old doorway  The horns of the crosstrees were sawed off on the other side so that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows  Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving  A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns yes TWO of them one for Queequeg and one for me Its ominous thinks I  A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstones staring at me in the whalemens chapel and here a gallows and a pair of prodigious black pots too Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet  I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt  Get along with ye said she to the man or Ill be combing ye  Come on Queequeg said I all right  Theres Mrs Hussey  And so it turned out Mr Hosea Hussey being from home but leaving Mrs Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs  Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed Mrs Hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a little room and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast turned round to us and saidClam or Cod  Whats that about Cods maam said I with much politeness  Clam or Cod she repeated  A clam for supper a cold clam is THAT what you mean Mrs Hussey says I but thats a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time aint it Mrs Hussey  But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing but the word clam Mrs Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared  Queequeg said I do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam  However a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us  But when that smoking chowder came in the mystery was delightfully explained  Oh sweet friends hearken to me  It was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into little flakes the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt  Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs Husseys clam and cod announcement I thought I would try a little experiment  Stepping to the kitchen door I uttered the word cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat  In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor and in good time a fine codchowder was placed before us  We resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks I to myself I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head Whats that stultifying saying about chowderheaded people  But look Queequeg aint that a live eel in your bowl  Wheres your harpoon  Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots which well deserved its name for the pots there were always boiling chowders  Chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you began to look for fishbones coming through your clothes  The area before the house was paved with clamshells  Mrs Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old sharkskin  There was a fishy flavor to the milk too which I could not at all account for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermens boats I saw Hoseas brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the sand with each foot in a cods decapitated head looking very slipshod I assure ye  Supper concluded we received a lamp and directions from Mrs Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed but as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers  Why not said I every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonbut why not  Because its dangerous says she  Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfortnt vyge of his when he was gone four years and a half with only three barrels of ILE was found dead in my first floor back with his harpoon in his side ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night  So Mr Queequeg for she had learned his name I will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning  But the chowder clam or cod tomorrow for breakfast men  Both says I and lets have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety CHAPTER 16  The ShipIn bed we concocted our plans for the morrow  But to my surprise and no small concern Queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been diligently consulting Yojothe name of his black little godand Yojo had told him two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it everyway that instead of our going together among the whalingfleet in harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this I say Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us and in order to do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself I Ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself for the present irrespective of Queequeg  I have forgotten to mention that in many things Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojos judgment and surprising forecast of things and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs  Now this plan of Queequegs or rather Yojos touching the selection of our craft I did not like that plan at all  I had not a little relied upon Queequegs sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely  But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg I was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little affair  Next morning early leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroomfor it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day HOW it was I never could find out for though I applied myself to it several times I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articlesleaving Queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings I sallied out among the shipping After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries I learnt that there were three ships up for threeyears voyagesThe Devildam the Titbit and the Pequod  DEVILDAM I do not know the origin of TITBIT is obvious PEQUOD you will no doubt remember was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians now extinct as the ancient Medes  I peered and pryed about the Devildam from her hopped over to the Titbit and finally going on board the Pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this was the very ship for us  You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught I knowsquaretoed luggers mountainous Japanese junks butterbox galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod  She was a ship of the old school rather small if anything with an oldfashioned clawfooted look about her  Long seasoned and weatherstained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans her old hulls complexion was darkened like a French grenadiers who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia  Her venerable bows looked bearded  Her mastscut somewhere on the coast of Japan where her original ones were lost overboard in a galeher masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne  Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrimworshipped flagstone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled  But to all these her old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed  Old Captain Peleg many years her chiefmate before he commanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the principal owners of the Pequodthis old Peleg during the term of his chiefmateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched by anything except it be ThorkillHakes carved buckler or bedstead  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory  She was a thing of trophies  A cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies  All round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to  Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of seaivory Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe  The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the Tartar when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw  A noble craft but somehow a most melancholy  All noble things are touched with that  Now when I looked about the quarterdeck for some one having authority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at first I saw nobody but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the mainmast  It seemed only a temporary erection used in port  It was of a conical shape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the rightwhale  Planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the topknot on some old Pottowottamie Sachems head  A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded a complete view forward  And half concealed in this queer tenement I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and the ships work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of command  He was seated on an oldfashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed  There was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of the elderly man I saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen and heavily rolled up in blue pilotcloth cut in the Quaker style only there was a fine and almost microscopic network of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking to windwardfor this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together  Such eyewrinkles are very effectual in a scowl  Is this the Captain of the Pequod said I advancing to the door of the tent  Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod what dost thou want of him he demanded  I was thinking of shipping  Thou wast wast thou  I see thou art no Nantucketerever been in a stove boat  No Sir I never have  Dost know nothing at all about whaling I dare sayeh  Nothing Sir but I have no doubt I shall soon learn  Ive been several voyages in the merchant service and I think that  Merchant service be damned  Talk not that lingo to me  Dost see that legIll take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again  Marchant service indeed  I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships  But flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling ehit looks a little suspicious dont it ehHast not been a pirate hast thouDidst not rob thy last Captain didst thouDost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea  I protested my innocence of these things  I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and rather distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard  But what takes thee awhaling  I want to know that before I think of shipping ye  Well sir I want to see what whaling is  I want to see the world  Want to see what whaling is eh  Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab  Who is Captain Ahab sir  Aye aye I thought so  Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship  I am mistaken then  I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself  Thou art speaking to Captain Pelegthats who ye are speaking to young man  It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew  We are part owners and agents  But as I was going to say if thou wantest to know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out  Clap eye on Captain Ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only one leg  What do you mean sir  Was the other one lost by a whale  Lost by a whale  Young man come nearer to me it was devoured chewed up crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boatah ah  I was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as I could What you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident  Look ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft dye see thou dost not talk shark a bit  SURE yeve been to sea before now sure of that  Sir said I I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant  Hard down out of that  Mind what I said about the marchant servicedont aggravate meI wont have it  But let us understand each other  I have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel inclined for it  I do sir  Very good  Now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whales throat and then jump after it  Answer quick  I am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be got rid of that is which I dont take to be the fact  Good again  Now then thou not only wantest to go awhaling to find out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to see the world  Was not that what ye said  I thought so Well then just step forward there and take a peep over the weatherbow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there  For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest But concentrating all his crows feet into one scowl Captain Peleg started me on the errand  Going forward and glancing over the weather bow I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the floodtide was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean  The prospect was unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that I could see  Well whats the report said Peleg when I came back what did ye see  Not much I repliednothing but water considerable horizon though and theres a squall coming up I think  Well what does thou think then of seeing the world  Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it eh  Cant ye see the world where you stand  I was a little staggered but go awhaling I must and I would and the Pequod was as good a ship as anyI thought the bestand all this I now repeated to Peleg  Seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness to ship me  And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he addedcome along with ye  And so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin  Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure  It turned out to be Captain Bildad who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship  People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest  Now Bildad like Peleg and indeed many other Nantucketers was a Quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous  For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whalehunters  They are fighting Quakers they are Quakers with a vengeance  So that there are instances among them of men who named with Scripture namesa singularly common fashion on the islandand in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not unworthy a Scandinavian seaking or a poetical Pagan Roman  And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long nightwatches in the remotest waters and beneath constellations never seen here at the north been led to think untraditionally and independently receiving all natures sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental advantages to learn a bold and nervous lofty languagethat man makes one in a whole nations censusa mighty pageant creature formed for noble tragedies  Nor will it at all detract from him dramatically regarded if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature  For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness  Be sure of this O young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease  But as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another phase of the Quaker modified by individual circumstances  Like Captain Peleg Captain Bildad was a welltodo retired whaleman  But unlike Captain Pelegwho cared not a rush for what are called serious things and indeed deemed those selfsame serious things the veriest of all triflesCaptain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism but all his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island creatures round the Hornall that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of his vest  Still for all this immutableness was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Peleg  Though refusing from conscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straightbodied coat spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore  How now in the contemplative evening of his days the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence I do not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a mans religion is one thing and this practical world quite another This world pays dividends  Rising from a little cabinboy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad shadbellied waistcoat from that becoming boatheader chiefmate and captain and finally a ship owner Bildad as I hinted before had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his wellearned income  Now Bildad I am sorry to say had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks and in his seagoing days a bitter hard taskmaster  They told me in Nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out  For a pious man especially for a Quaker he was certainly rather hardhearted to say the least  He never used to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them  When Bildad was a chiefmate to have his drabcoloured eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch somethinga hammer or a marlingspike and go to work like mad at something or other never mind what  Indolence and idleness perished before him  His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character  On his long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his broadbrimmed hat  Such then was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin  The space between the decks was small and there boltupright sat old Bildad who always sat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tails  His broadbrim was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume  Bildad cried Captain Peleg at it again Bildad eh  Ye have been studying those Scriptures now for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge  How far ye got Bildad  As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate Bildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up and seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg  He says hes our man Bildad said Peleg he wants to ship  Dost thee said Bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me  I dost said I unconsciously he was so intense a Quaker  What do ye think of him Bildad said Peleg  Hell do said Bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible  I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw especially as Peleg his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer  But I said nothing only looking round me sharply  Peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ships articles placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table  I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage  I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares of the profits called lays and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ships company  I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own lay would not be very large but considering that I was used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th laythat is the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to  And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather LONG LAY yet it was better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it not to speak of my three years beef and board for which I would not have to pay one stiver  It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortuneand so it was a very poor way indeed  But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud  Upon the whole I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th considering I was of a broadshouldered make  But one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this Ashore I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners left nearly the whole management of the ships affairs to these two And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands especially as I now found him on board the Pequod quite at home there in the cabin and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside  Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jackknife old Bildad to my no small surprise considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings Bildad never heeded us but went on mumbling to himself out of his book LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth  Well Captain Bildad interrupted Peleg what dye say what lay shall we give this young man  Thou knowest best was the sepulchral reply the seven hundred and seventyseventh wouldnt be too much would itwhere moth and rust do corrupt but LAY  LAY indeed thought I and such a lay the seven hundred and seventyseventh  Well old Bildad you are determined that I for one shall not LAY up many LAYS here below where moth and rust do corrupt  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that indeed and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventyseven is a pretty large number yet when you come to make a TEENTH of it you will then see I say that the seven hundred and seventyseventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventyseven gold doubloons and so I thought at the time  Why blast your eyes Bildad cried Peleg thou dost not want to swindle this young man he must have more than that  Seven hundred and seventyseventh again said Bildad without lifting his eyes and then went on mumblingfor where your treasure is there will your heart be also  I am going to put him down for the three hundredth said Peleg do ye hear that Bildad  The three hundredth lay I say  Bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said Captain Peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this shipwidows and orphans many of themand that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans  The seven hundred and seventyseventh lay Captain Peleg  Thou Bildad roared Peleg starting up and clattering about the cabin  Blast ye Captain Bildad if I had followed thy advice in these matters I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn  Captain Peleg said Bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms I cant tell but as thou art still an impenitent man Captain Peleg I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit Captain Peleg  Fiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye insult me  Its an allfired outrage to tell any human creature that hes bound to hell  Flukes and flames  Bildad say that again to me and start my soulbolts but IllIllyes Ill swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on  Out of the cabin ye canting drabcoloured son of a wooden guna straight wake with ye  As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad but with a marvellous oblique sliding celerity Bildad for that time eluded him  Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad who I made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg  But to my astonishment he sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways  As for Peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated  Whew he whistled at lastthe squalls gone off to leeward I think Bildad thou used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye  My jackknife here needs the grindstone  Thats he thank ye Bildad  Now then my young man Ishmaels thy name didnt ye say  Well then down ye go here Ishmael for the three hundredth lay  Captain Peleg said I I have a friend with me who wants to ship tooshall I bring him down tomorrow  To be sure said Peleg  Fetch him along and well look at him  What lay does he want groaned Bildad glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself  Oh never thee mind about that Bildad said Peleg  Has he ever whaled it any turning to me  Killed more whales than I can count Captain Peleg  Well bring him along then  And after signing the papers off I went nothing doubting but that I had done a good mornings work and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape  But I had not proceeded far when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me though indeed in many cases a whaleship will be completely fitted out and receive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea  However it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found  And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab  Its all right enough thou art shipped  Yes but I should like to see him  But I dont think thou wilt be able to at present  I dont know exactly whats the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a sort of sick and yet he dont look so  In fact he aint sick but no he isnt well either  Any how young man he wont always see me so I dont suppose he will thee  Hes a queer man Captain Ahabso some thinkbut a good one  Oh thoult like him well enough no fear no fear  Hes a grand ungodly godlike man Captain Ahab doesnt speak much but when he does speak then you may well listen  Mark ye be forewarned Ahabs above the common Ahabs been in colleges as well as mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales  His lance aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle  Oh he aint Captain Bildad no and he aint Captain Peleg HES AHAB boy and Ahab of old thou knowest was a crowned king  And a very vile one  When that wicked king was slain the dogs did they not lick his blood  Come hither to mehither hither said Peleg with a significance in his eye that almost startled me  Look ye lad never say that on board the Pequod  Never say it anywhere  Captain Ahab did not name himself  Twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died when he was only a twelvemonth old  And yet the old squaw Tistig at Gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic  And perhaps other fools like her may tell thee the same  I wish to warn thee  Its a lie  I know Captain Ahab well Ive sailed with him as mate years ago I know what he isa good mannot a pious good man like Bildad but a swearing good mansomething like meonly theres a good deal more of him  Aye aye I know that he was never very jolly and I know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about as any one might see  I know too that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale hes been a kind of moodydesperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass off  And once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man its better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one  So goodbye to theeand wrong not Captain Ahab because he happens to have a wicked name  Besides my boy he has a wifenot three voyages weddeda sweet resigned girl  Think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in Ahab  No no my lad stricken blasted if he be Ahab has his humanities  As I walked away I was full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him  And somehow at the time I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for I dont know what unless it was the cruel loss of his leg  And yet I also felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which I cannot at all describe was not exactly awe I do not know what it was  But I felt it and it did not disincline me towards him though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him so imperfectly as he was known to me then  However my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind CHAPTER 17  The RamadanAs Queequegs Ramadan or Fasting and Humiliation was to continue all day I did not choose to disturb him till towards nightfall for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybodys religious obligations never mind how comical and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toadstool or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name  I say we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals pagans and what not because of their halfcrazy conceits on these subjects  There was Queequeg now certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadanbut what of that Queequeg thought he knew what he was about I suppose he seemed to be content and there let him rest  All our arguing with him would not avail let him be I say and Heaven have mercy on us allPresbyterians and Pagans alikefor we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mending  Towards evening when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over I went up to his room and knocked at the door but no answer  I tried to open it but it was fastened inside Queequeg said I softly through the keyholeall silent  I say Queequeg why dont you speak  Its IIshmael  But all remained still as before  I began to grow alarmed  I had allowed him such abundant time I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit  I looked through the keyhole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room the keyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one  I could only see part of the footboard of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more  I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequegs harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him before our mounting to the chamber  Thats strange thought I but at any rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake  QueequegQueequegall still  Something must have happened Apoplexy  I tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted  Running down stairs I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I metthe chambermaid  La la she cried I thought something must be the matter  I went to make the bed after breakfast and the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard and its been just so silent ever since  But I thought may be you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping  La la maamMistress murder  Mrs Hussey apoplexyand with these cries she ran towards the kitchen I following  Mrs Hussey soon appeared with a mustardpot in one hand and a vinegarcruet in the other having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors and scolding her little black boy meantime  Woodhouse cried I which way to it  Run for Gods sake and fetch something to pry open the doorthe axethe axe hes had a stroke depend upon itand so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs again emptyhanded when Mrs Hussey interposed the mustardpot and vinegarcruet and the entire castor of her countenance  Whats the matter with you young man  Get the axe  For Gods sake run for the doctor some one while I pry it open  Look here said the landlady quickly putting down the vinegarcruet so as to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying open any of my doorsand with that she seized my arm  Whats the matter with you  Whats the matter with you shipmate  In as calm but rapid a manner as possible I gave her to understand the whole case  Unconsciously clapping the vinegarcruet to one side of her nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimedNo  I havent seen it since I put it there  Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me that Queequegs harpoon was missing  Hes killed himself she cried  Its unfortnate Stiggs done over again there goes another counterpaneGod pity his poor motherit will be the ruin of my house  Has the poor lad a sister  Wheres that girlthere Betty go to Snarles the Painter and tell him to paint me a sign withno suicides permitted here and no smoking in the parlormight as well kill both birds at once  Kill  The Lord be merciful to his ghost  Whats that noise there  You young man avast there  And running up after me she caught me as I was again trying to force open the door  I dont allow it I wont have my premises spoiled  Go for the locksmith theres one about a mile from here  But avast putting her hand in her sidepocket heres a key thatll fit I guess lets see  And with that she turned it in the lock but alas Queequegs supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within  Have to burst it open said I and was running down the entry a little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing I should not break down her premises but I tore from her and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark  With a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good heavens there sat Queequeg altogether cool and selfcollected right in the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding Yojo on top of his head  He looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life  Queequeg said I going up to him Queequeg whats the matter with you  He haint been a sittin so all day has he said the landlady  But all we said not a word could we drag out of him I almost felt like pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost intolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours going too without his regular meals  Mrs Hussey said I hes ALIVE at all events so leave us if you please and I will see to this strange affair myself  Closing the door upon the landlady I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair but in vain  There he sat and all he could dofor all my polite arts and blandishmentshe would not move a peg nor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in the slightest way  I wonder thought I if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan do they fast on their hams that way in his native island  It must be so yes its part of his creed I suppose well then let him rest hell get up sooner or later no doubt  It cant last for ever thank God and his Ramadan only comes once a year and I dont believe its very punctual then  I went down to supper  After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plumpudding voyage as they called it that is a short whalingvoyage in a schooner or brig confined to the north of the line in the Atlantic Ocean only after listening to these plumpuddingers till nearly eleven oclock I went up stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination  But no there he was just where I had left him he had not stirred an inch  I began to grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room holding a piece of wood on his head  For heavens sake Queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and have some supper  Youll starve youll kill yourself Queequeg But not a word did he reply  Despairing of him therefore I determined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt before a great while he would follow me  But previous to turning in I took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on  For some time do all I would I could not get into the faintest doze  I had blown out the candle and the mere thought of Queequegnot four feet offsitting there in that uneasy position stark alone in the cold and dark this made me really wretched  Think of it sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary unaccountable Ramadan  But somehow I dropped off at last and knew nothing more till break of day when looking over the bedside there squatted Queequeg as if he had been screwed down to the floor  But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints but with a cheerful look limped towards me where I lay pressed his forehead again against mine and said his Ramadan was over  Now as I before hinted I have no objection to any persons religion be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person because that other person dont believe it also  But when a mans religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment to him and in fine makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him  And just so I now did with Queequeg  Queequeg said I get into bed now and lie and listen to me  I then went on beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions and coming down to the various religions of the present time during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents Ramadans and prolonged hamsquattings in cold cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed in short to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense  I told him too that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly pained me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his  Besides argued I fasting makes the body cave in hence the spirit caves in and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be halfstarved This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters  In one word Queequeg said I rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested appledumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans  I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it in  He said no only upon one memorable occasion  It was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two oclock in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening  No more Queequeg said I shuddering that will do for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them  I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island and he told me that it was the custom when a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they were placed in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a pilau with breadfruit and cocoanuts and with some parsley in their mouths were sent round with the victors compliments to all his friends just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys  After all I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon Queequeg  Because in the first place he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered from his own point of view and in the second place he did not more than one third understand me couch my ideas simply as I would and finally he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did  He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety  At last we rose and dressed and Queequeg taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan we sallied out to board the Pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bones CHAPTER 18  His MarkAs we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship Queequeg carrying his harpoon Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced their papers  What do you mean by that Captain Peleg said I now jumping on the bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf  I mean he replied he must show his papers  Yes said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from behind Pelegs out of the wigwam  He must show that hes converted  Son of darkness he added turning to Queequeg art thou at present in communion with any Christian church  Why said I hes a member of the first Congregational Church Here be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches  First Congregational Church cried Bildad what that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Colemans meetinghouse and so saying taking out his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long look at Queequeg  How long hath he been a member he then said turning to me not very long I rather guess young man  No said Peleg and he hasnt been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that devils blue off his face  Do tell now cried Bildad is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomys meeting  I never saw him going there and I pass it every Lords day  I dont know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting said I all I know is that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church  He is a deacon himself Queequeg is  Young man said Bildad sternly thou art skylarking with meexplain thyself thou young Hittite  What church dost thee mean answer me  Finding myself thus hard pushed I replied  I mean sir the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I and Captain Peleg there and Queequeg here and all of us and every mothers son and soul of us belong the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in THAT we all join hands  Splice thou meanst SPLICE hands cried Peleg drawing nearer Young man youd better ship for a missionary instead of a foremast hand I never heard a better sermon  Deacon Deuteronomywhy Father Mapple himself couldnt beat it and hes reckoned something  Come aboard come aboard never mind about the papers  I say tell Quohog therewhats that you call him tell Quohog to step along  By the great anchor what a harpoon hes got there looks like good stuff that and he handles it about right  I say Quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head of a whaleboat did you ever strike a fish  Without saying a word Queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboats hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this  Capain you see him small drop tar on water dere  You see him well spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over old Bildads broad brim clean across the ships decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight  Now said Queequeg quietly hauling in the line sposee him whalee eye why dad whale dead  Quick Bildad said Peleg his partner who aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway  Quick I say you Bildad and get the ships papers  We must have Hedgehog there I mean Quohog in one of our boats  Look ye Quohog well give ye the ninetieth lay and thats more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket  So down we went into the cabin and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ships company to which I myself belonged  When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for signing he turned to me and said I guess Quohog there dont know how to write does he  I say Quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark  But at this question Queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but taking the offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm so that through Captain Pelegs obstinate mistake touching his appellative it stood something like this  Quohog his X mark  Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts and selecting one entitled The Latter Day Coming or No Time to Lose placed it in Queequegs hands and then grasping them and the book with both his looked earnestly into his eyes and said Son of darkness I must do my duty by thee I am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways which I sadly fear I beseech thee remain not for aye a Belial bondsman  Spurn the idol Bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye I say oh goodness gracious steer clear of the fiery pit  Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildads language heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases  Avast there avast there Bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer Peleg  Pious harpooneers never make good voyagersit takes the shark out of em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish  There was young Nat Swaine once the bravest boatheader out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to good  He got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of afterclaps in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones  Peleg  Peleg said Bildad lifting his eyes and hands thou thyself as I myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest Peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then canst thou prate in this ungodly guise  Thou beliest thine own heart Peleg Tell me when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab didst thou not think of Death and the Judgment then  Hear him hear him now cried Peleg marching across the cabin and thrusting his hands far down into his pocketshear him all of ye Think of that  When every moment we thought the ship would sink Death and the Judgment then  What  With all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over us fore and aft  Think of Death and the Judgment then  No no time to think about Death then  Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of and how to save all handshow to rig jurymastshow to get into the nearest port that was what I was thinking of  Bildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him  There he stood very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a topsail in the waist  Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted CHAPTER 19  The ProphetShipmates have ye shipped in that ship  Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod and were sauntering away from the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when the above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question  He was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck  A confluent smallpox had in all directions flowed over his face and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried up  Have ye shipped in her he repeated  You mean the ship Pequod I suppose said I trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him  Aye the Pequodthat ship there he said drawing back his whole arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object  Yes said I we have just signed the articles  Anything down there about your souls  About what  Oh perhaps you havnt got any he said quickly  No matter though I know many chaps that havnt got anygood luck to em and they are all the better off for it  A souls a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon  What are you jabbering about shipmate said I  HES got enough though to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous emphasis upon the word HE  Queequeg said I lets go this fellow has broken loose from somewhere hes talking about something and somebody we dont know  Stop cried the stranger  Ye said trueye havnt seen Old Thunder yet have ye  Whos Old Thunder said I again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner  Captain Ahab  What the captain of our ship the Pequod  Aye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name  Ye havnt seen him yet have ye  No we havnt  Hes sick they say but is getting better and will be all right again before long  All right again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh  Look ye when Captain Ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right not before  What do you know about him  What did they TELL you about him  Say that  They didnt tell much of anything about him only Ive heard that hes a good whalehunter and a good captain to his crew  Thats true thats trueyes both true enough  But you must jump when he gives an order  Step and growl growl and gothats the word with Captain Ahab  But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santaheard nothing about that eh  Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into  And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage according to the prophecy  Didnt ye hear a word about them matters and something more eh  No I dont think ye did how could ye  Who knows it  Not all Nantucket I guess  But howsever mayhap yeve heard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that I dare say  Oh yes THAT every one knows amostI mean they know hes only one leg and that a parmacetti took the other off  My friend said I what all this gibberish of yours is about I dont know and I dont much care for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head  But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab of that ship there the Pequod then let me tell you that I know all about the loss of his leg  ALL about it ehsure you doall  Pretty sure  With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod the beggarlike stranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then starting a little turned and saidYeve shipped have ye  Names down on the papers  Well well whats signed is signed and whats to be will be and then again perhaps it wont be after all  Anyhow its all fixed and arranged aready and some sailors or other must go with him I suppose as well these as any other men God pity em Morning to ye shipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye Im sorry I stopped ye  Look here friend said I if you have anything important to tell us out with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle us you are mistaken in your game thats all I have to say  And its said very well and I like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for himthe likes of ye  Morning to ye shipmates morning  Oh when ye get there tell em Ive concluded not to make one of em  Ah my dear fellow you cant fool us that wayyou cant fool us It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him  Morning to ye shipmates morning  Morning it is said I  Come along Queequeg lets leave this crazy man  But stop tell me your name will you  Elijah  Elijah thought I and we walked away both commenting after each others fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear  But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner and looking back as I did so who should be seen but Elijah following us though at a distance  Somehow the sight of him struck me so that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did  He did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine  This circumstance coupled with his ambiguous halfhinting halfrevealing shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and halfapprehensions and all connected with the Pequod and Captain Ahab and the leg he had lost and the Cape Horn fit and the silver calabash and what Captain Peleg had said of him when I left the ship the day previous and the prediction of the squaw Tistig and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowy things  I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg and on that side of it retraced our steps  But Elijah passed on without seeming to notice us  This relieved me and once more and finally as it seemed to me I pronounced him in my heart a humbug CHAPTER 20  All AstirA day or two passed and there was great activity aboard the Pequod Not only were the old sails being mended but new sails were coming on board and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in short everything betokened that the ships preparations were hurrying to a close  Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp lookout upon the hands Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after nightfall  On the day following Queequegs signing the articles word was given at all the inns where the ships company were stopping that their chests must be on board before night for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing  So Queequeg and I got down our traps resolving however to sleep ashore till the last  But it seems they always give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not sail for several days  But no wonder there was a good deal to be done and there is no telling how many things to be thought of before the Pequod was fully equipped  Every one knows what a multitude of thingsbeds saucepans knives and forks shovels and tongs napkins nutcrackers and what not are indispensable to the business of housekeeping  Just so with whaling which necessitates a threeyears housekeeping upon the wide ocean far from all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers  And though this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen  For besides the great length of the whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented it must be remembered that of all ships whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends Hence the spare boats spare spars and spare lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but a spare Captain and duplicate ship  At the period of our arrival at the Island the heaviest storage of the Pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water fuel and iron hoops and staves  But as before hinted for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things both large and small  Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildads sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if SHE could help it nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod after once fairly getting to sea  At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the stewards pantry another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mates desk where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some ones rheumatic back  Never did any woman better deserve her name which was CharityAunt Charity as everybody called her  And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two of wellsaved dollars  But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board as she did the last day with a long oilladle in one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other  Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward  As for Bildad he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the men down the hatchways roaring up to the riggers at the masthead and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam  During these days of preparation Queequeg and I often visited the craft and as often I asked about Captain Ahab and how he was and when he was going to come on board his ship  To these questions they would answer that he was getting better and better and was expected aboard every day meantime the two captains Peleg and Bildad could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage  If I had been downright honest with myself I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea  But when a man suspects any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself  And much this way it was with me  I said nothing and tried to think nothing  At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail  So next morning Queequeg and I took a very early start CHAPTER 21  Going AboardIt was nearly six oclock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we drew nigh the wharf  There are some sailors running ahead there if I see right said I to Queequeg it cant be shadows shes off by sunrise I guess come on  Avast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close behind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuating himself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely peering from Queequeg to me  It was Elijah  Going aboard  Hands off will you said I  Lookee here said Queequeg shaking himself go way  Aint going aboard then  Yes we are said I but what business is that of yours  Do you know Mr Elijah that I consider you a little impertinent  No no no I wasnt aware of that said Elijah slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg with the most unaccountable glances  Elijah said I you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans and would prefer not to be detained  Ye be be ye  Coming back afore breakfast  Hes cracked Queequeg said I come on  Holloa cried stationary Elijah hailing us when we had removed a few paces  Never mind him said I Queequeg come on  But he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder saidDid ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago  Struck by this plain matteroffact question I answered saying Yes I thought I did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure  Very dim very dim said Elijah  Morning to ye  Once more we quitted him but once more he came softly after us and touching my shoulder again said See if you can find em now will ye  Find who  Morning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off  Oh I was going to warn ye againstbut never mind never mindits all one all in the family toosharp frost this morning aint it Goodbye to ye  Shant see ye again very soon I guess unless its before the Grand Jury  And with these cracked words he finally departed leaving me for the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence  At last stepping on board the Pequod we found everything in profound quiet not a soul moving  The cabin entrance was locked within the hatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging Going forward to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open  Seeing a light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered peajacket  He was thrown at whole length upon two chests his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms  The profoundest slumber slept upon him  Those sailors we saw Queequeg where can they have gone to said I looking dubiously at the sleeper  But it seemed that when on the wharf Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to hence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter were it not for Elijahs otherwise inexplicable question But I beat the thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body telling him to establish himself accordingly  He put his hand upon the sleepers rear as though feeling if it was soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly down there  Gracious  Queequeg dont sit there said I  Oh perry dood seat said Queequeg my country way wont hurt him face  Face said I call that his face very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes hes heaving himself get off Queequeg you are heavy its grinding the face of the poor  Get off Queequeg  Look hell twitch you off soon  I wonder he dont wake  Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe  I sat at the feet  We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other  Meanwhile upon questioning him in his broken fashion Queequeg gave me to understand that in his land owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts the king chiefs and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay them round in the piers and alcoves  Besides it was very convenient on an excursion much better than those gardenchairs which are convertible into walkingsticks upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps in some damp marshy place  While narrating these things every time Queequeg received the tomahawk from me he flourished the hatchetside of it over the sleepers head  Whats that for Queequeg  Perry easy kille oh perry easy  He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawkpipe which it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger  The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole it began to tell upon him  He breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and rubbed his eyes  Holloa he breathed at last who be ye smokers  Shipped men answered I when does she sail  Aye aye ye are going in her be ye  She sails today  The Captain came aboard last night  What CaptainAhab  Who but him indeed  I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab when we heard a noise on deck  Holloa  Starbucks astir said the rigger  Hes a lively chief mate that good man and a pious but all alive now I must turn to  And so saying he went on deck and we followed  It was now clear sunrise  Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board  Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin CHAPTER 22  Merry ChristmasAt length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ships riggers and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and after the everthoughtful Charity had come off in a whaleboat with her last gifta nightcap for Stubb the second mate her brotherinlaw and a spare Bible for the stewardafter all this the two Captains Peleg and Bildad issued from the cabin and turning to the chief mate Peleg said  Now Mr Starbuck are you sure everything is right  Captain Ahab is all readyjust spoke to himnothing more to be got from shore eh  Well call all hands then  Muster em aft hereblast em  No need of profane words however great the hurry Peleg said Bildad but away with thee friend Starbuck and do our bidding  How now  Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarterdeck just as if they were to be jointcommanders at sea as well as to all appearances in port  And as for Captain Ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin But then the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea Indeed as that was not at all his proper business but the pilots and as he was not yet completely recoveredso they saidtherefore Captain Ahab stayed below  And all this seemed natural enough especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewell merrymaking with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good with the pilot  But there was not much chance to think over the matter for Captain Peleg was now all alive  He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding and not Bildad  Aft here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingered at the mainmast  Mr Starbuck driveem aft  Strike the tent therewas the next order  As I hinted before this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the Pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor  Man the capstan  Blood and thunderjumpwas the next command and the crew sprang for the handspikes  Now in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship  And here Bildad who with Peleg be it known in addition to his other officers was one of the licensed pilots of the porthe being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilotfee to all the ships he was concerned in for he never piloted any other craftBildad I say might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley with hearty good will  Nevertheless not three days previous Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod particularly in getting under weigh and Charity his sister had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seamans berth  Meantime overseeing the other part of the ship Captain Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner  I almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily I paused on my handspike and told Queequeg to do the same thinking of the perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot  I was comforting myself however with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred and seventyseventh lay when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity  That was my first kick  Is that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared Spring thou sheephead spring and break thy backbone  Why dont ye spring I say all of yespring  Quohog spring thou chap with the red whiskers spring there Scotchcap spring thou green pants  Spring I say all of ye and spring your eyes out  And so saying he moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody  Thinks I Captain Peleg must have been drinking something today  At last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided  It was a short cold Christmas and as the short northern day merged into night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor  The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving icicles depended from the bows  Lank Bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon as the old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shivering frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady notes were heard  Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood Stand dressed in living green So to the Jews old Canaan stood While Jordan rolled betweenNever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then  They were full of hope and fruition  Spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer  At last we gained such an offing that the two pilots were needed no longer  The stout sailboat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside  It was curious and not unpleasing how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this juncture especially Captain Bildad  For loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyagebeyond both stormy Capes a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested a ship in which an old shipmate sailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say goodbye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to himpoor old Bildad lingered long paced the deck with anxious strides ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and looked to windward looked towards the wide and endless waters only bounded by the faroff unseen Eastern Continents looked towards the land looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand and holding up a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to say Nevertheless friend Peleg I can stand it yes I can  As for Peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all his philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near  And he too did not a little run from cabin to decknow a word below and now a word with Starbuck the chief mate  But at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look about himCaptain Bildadcome old shipmate we must go  Back the mainyard there  Boat ahoy  Stand by to come close alongside now  Careful carefulcome Bildad boysay your last  Luck to ye Starbuckluck to ye Mr Stubbluck to ye Mr Flaskgoodbye and good luck to ye alland this day three years Ill have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket  Hurrah and away  God bless ye and have ye in His holy keeping men murmured old Bildad almost incoherently  I hope yell have fine weather now so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among yea pleasant sun is all he needs and yell have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go Be careful in the hunt ye mates  Dont stave the boats needlessly ye harpooneers good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent within the year  Dont forget your prayers either  Mr Starbuck mind that cooper dont waste the spare staves  Oh the sailneedles are in the green locker  Dont whale it too much a Lords days men but dont miss a fair chance either thats rejecting Heavens good gifts  Have an eye to the molasses tierce Mr Stubb it was a little leaky I thought  If ye touch at the islands Mr Flask beware of fornication  Goodbye goodbye  Dont keep that cheese too long down in the hold Mr Starbuck itll spoil  Be careful with the buttertwenty cents the pound it was and mind ye if  Come come Captain Bildad stop palaveringaway and with that Peleg hurried him over the side and both dropt into the boat  Ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between a screaming gull flew overhead the two hulls wildly rolled we gave three heavyhearted cheers and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic CHAPTER 23  The Lee ShoreSome chapters back one Bulkington was spoken of a tall newlanded mariner encountered in New Bedford at the inn  When on that shivering winters night the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves who should I see standing at her helm but Bulkington  I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man who in midwinter just landed from a four years dangerous voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term  The land seemed scorching to his feet  Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable deep memories yield no epitaphs this sixinch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington  Let me only say that it fared with him as with the stormtossed ship that miserably drives along the leeward land  The port would fain give succor the port is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm blankets friends all thats kind to our mortalities  But in that gale the port the land is that ships direst jeopardy

Bulkington  Bear thee grimly demigod  Up from the spray of thy oceanperishingstraight up leaps thy apotheosis CHAPTER 24  The AdvocateAs Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore I am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales  In the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits were he presented to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials SWF Sperm Whale Fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed preeminently presuming and ridiculous  Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us whalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilements  Butchers we are that is true  But butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour  And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whaleship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth  But even granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery decks of a whaleship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battlefields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies plaudits  And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldiers profession let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whales vast tail fanning into eddies the air over his head  For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God  But though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage yea an allabounding adoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles that burn round the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory  But look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of scales see what we whalemen are and have been  Why did the Dutch in De Witts time have admirals of their whaling fleets  Why did Louis XVI of France at his own personal expense fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket  Why did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of L1000000  And lastly how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels manned by eighteen thousand men yearly consuming 4000000 of dollars the ships worth at the time of sailing 20000000 and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of 7000000  How comes all this if there be not something puissant in whaling  But this is not the half look again  I freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his life point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling One way and another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb  It would be a hopeless endless task to catalogue all these things  Let a handful suffice For many years past the whaleship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth  She has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed  If American and European menofwar now peacefully ride in once savage harbors let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the whaleship which originally showed them the way and first interpreted between them and the savages  They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions your Cooks your Krusensterns but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket that were as great and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern  For in their succourless emptyhandedness they in the heathenish sharked waters and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared  All that is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages those things were but the lifetime commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers  Often adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ships common log  Ah the world  Oh the world  Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast  It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown touching those colonies and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru Chili and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts  That great America on the other side of the sphere Australia was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman  After its first blunderborn discovery by a Dutchman all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous but the whaleship touched there  The whaleship is the true mother of that now mighty colony Moreover in the infancy of the first Australian settlement the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whaleship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whaleship that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations  If that doublebolted land Japan is ever to become hospitable it is the whaleship alone to whom the credit will be due for already she is on the threshold  But if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet every time  The whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you will say  THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER  Who wrote the first account of our Leviathan  Who but mighty Job  And who composed the first narrative of a whalingvoyage  Who but no less a prince than Alfred the Great who with his own royal pen took down the words from Other the Norwegian whalehunter of those times  And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament  Who but Edmund Burke  True enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they have no good blood in their veins  NO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS  They have something better than royal blood there  The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel afterwards by marriage Mary Folger one of the old settlers of Nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneersall kith and kin to noble Benjaminthis day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other  Good again but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable  WHALING NOT RESPECTABLE  Whaling is imperial  By old English statutory law the whale is declared a royal fish  Oh thats only nominal  The whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing way  THE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY  In one of the mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the worlds capital the bones of a whale brought all the way from the Syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed processionSee subsequent chapters for something more on this headGrant it since you cite it but say what you will there is no real dignity in whaling  NO DIGNITY IN WHALING  The dignity of our calling the very heavens attest  Cetus is a constellation in the South  No more  Drive down your hat in presence of the Czar and take it off to Queequeg No more  I know a man that in his lifetime has taken three hundred and fifty whales  I account that man more honourable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns  And as for me if by any possibility there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of if hereafter I shall do anything that upon the whole a man might rather have done than to have left undone if at my death my executors or more properly my creditors find any precious MSS in my desk then here I prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling for a whaleship was my Yale College and my Harvard CHAPTER 25  PostscriptIn behalf of the dignity of whaling I would fain advance naught but substantiated facts  But after embattling his facts an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might tell eloquently upon his causesuch an advocate would he not be blameworthy  It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens even modern ones a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through  There is a saltcellar of state so called and there may be a castor of state  How they use the salt preciselywho knows  Certain I am however that a kings head is solemnly oiled at his coronation even as a head of salad  Can it be though that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well as they anoint machinery  Much might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably smells of that anointing  In truth a mature man who uses hairoil unless medicinally that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere  As a general rule he cant amount to much in his totality  But the only thing to be considered here is thiswhat kind of oil is used at coronations  Certainly it cannot be olive oil nor macassar oil nor castor oil nor bears oil nor train oil nor codliver oil  What then can it possibly be but sperm oil in its unmanufactured unpolluted state the sweetest of all oils  Think of that ye loyal Britons we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff CHAPTER 26  Knights and SquiresThe chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck a native of Nantucket and a Quaker by descent  He was a long earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes his flesh being hard as twicebaked biscuit  Transported to the Indies his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale  He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous  Only some thirty arid summers had he seen those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness  But this his thinness so to speak seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight  It was merely the condensation of the man  He was by no means illlooking quite the contrary  His pure tight skin was an excellent fit and closely wrapped up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified Egyptian this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come and to endure always as now for be it Polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates  Looking into his eyes you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousandfold perils he had calmly confronted through life  A staid steadfast man whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sounds  Yet for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain qualities in him which at times affected and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in some organizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance  Outward portents and inward presentiments were his  And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul much more did his faraway domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those latent influences which in some honesthearted men restrain the gush of daredevil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery  I will have no man in my boat said Starbuck who is not afraid of a whale  By this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward  Aye aye said Stubb the second mate Starbuck there is as careful a man as youll find anywhere in this fishery  But we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a man like Stubb or almost any other whale hunter  Starbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a sentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions  Besides he thought perhaps that in this business of whaling courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted  Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sundown nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him  For thought Starbuck I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew  What doom was his own fathers  Where in the bottomless deeps could he find the torn limbs of his brother  With memories like these in him and moreover given to a certain superstitiousness as has been said the courage of this Starbuck which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him which under suitable circumstances would break out from its confinement and burn all his courage up And brave as he might be it was that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas or winds or whales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world yet cannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrors which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man  But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor Starbucks fortitude scarce might I have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose the fall of valour in the soul  Men may seem detestable as joint stockcompanies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be men may have mean and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes  That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so far within us that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valorruined man  Nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars  But this august dignity I treat of is not the dignity of kings and robes but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture  Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that democratic dignity which on all hands radiates without end from God Himself  The great God absolute  The centre and circumference of all democracy  His omnipresence our divine equality  If then to meanest mariners and renegades and castaways I shall hereafter ascribe high qualities though dark weave round them tragic graces if even the most mournful perchance the most abased among them all shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts if I shall touch that workmans arm with some ethereal light if I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun then against all mortal critics bear me out in it thou Just Spirit of Equality which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind Bear me out in it thou great democratic God who didst not refuse to the swart convict Bunyan the pale poetic pearl Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles who didst hurl him upon a warhorse who didst thunder him higher than a throne  Thou who in all Thy mighty earthly marchings ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the kingly commons bear me out in it O God CHAPTER 27  Knights and SquiresStubb was the second mate  He was a native of Cape Cod and hence according to local usage was called a CapeCodman  A happygolucky neither craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year  Goodhumored easy and careless he presided over his whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his crew all invited guests  He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat as an old stagedriver is about the snugness of his box  When close to the whale in the very deathlock of the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and offhandedly as a whistling tinker his hammer  He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster  Long usage had for this Stubb converted the jaws of death into an easy chair  What he thought of death itself there is no telling  Whether he ever thought of it at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order and not sooner  What perhaps with other things made Stubb such an easygoing unfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that almost impious goodhumor of his that thing must have been his pipe  For like his nose his short black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe  He kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in readiness anew  For when Stubb dressed instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers he put his pipe into his mouth  I say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his peculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air whether ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and as in time of the cholera some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths so likewise against all mortal tribulations Stubbs tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent  The third mate was Flask a native of Tisbury in Marthas Vineyard A short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him to destroy them whenever encountered  So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse or at least waterrat requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil  This ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a three years voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time  As a carpenters nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly divided  Little Flask was one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long  They called him KingPost on board of the Pequod because in form he could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in Arctic whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas  Now these three matesStarbuck Stubb and Flask were momentous men  They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the Pequods boats as headsmen  In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales these three headsmen were as captains of companies  Or being armed with their long keen whaling spears they were as a picked trio of lancers even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins  And since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a Gothic Knight of old is always accompanied by his boatsteerer or harpooneer who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance when the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault and moreover as there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy and friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we set down who the Pequods harpooneers were and to what headsman each of them belonged  First of all was Queequeg whom Starbuck the chief mate had selected for his squire  But Queequeg is already known  Next was Tashtego an unmixed Indian from Gay Head the most westerly promontory of Marthas Vineyard where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers  In the fishery they usually go by the generic name of GayHeaders  Tashtegos long lean sable hair his high cheek bones and black rounding eyesfor an Indian Oriental in their largeness but Antarctic in their glittering expressionall this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters who in quest of the great New England moose had scoured bow in hand the aboriginal forests of the main But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires  To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans and halfbelieved this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air  Tashtego was Stubb the second mates squire  Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo a gigantic coalblack negrosavage with a lionlike treadan Ahasuerus to behold Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops so large that the sailors called them ringbolts and would talk of securing the topsail halyards to them  In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native coast  And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa Nantucket and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues and erect as a giraffe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks  There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress  Curious to tell this imperial negro Ahasuerus Daggoo was the Squire of little Flask who looked like a chessman beside him  As for the residue of the Pequods company be it said that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery are Americans born though pretty nearly all the officers are  Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military and merchant navies and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and Railroads  The same I say because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the brains the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles  No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores In like manner the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London put in at the Shetland Islands to receive the full complement of their crew  Upon the passage homewards they drop them there again How it is there is no telling but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen  They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod ISOLATOES too I call such not acknowledging the common continent of men but each ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his own  Yet now federated along one keel what a set these Isolatoes were  An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea and all the ends of the earth accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the worlds grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back  Black Little Piphe never didoh no he went before  Poor Alabama boy  On the grim Pequods forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when sent for to the great quarterdeck on high he was bid strike in with angels and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there CHAPTER 28  AhabFor several days after leaving Nantucket nothing above hatches was seen of Captain Ahab  The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously  Yes their supreme lord and dictator was there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin  Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation  This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijahs diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of  But poorly could I withstand them much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves  But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasinessto call it sowhich I felt yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions  For though the harpooneers with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the tame merchantship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with still I ascribed thisand rightly ascribed itto the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked  But it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship the mates which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage  Three better more likely seaofficers and men each in his own different way could not readily be found and they were every one of them Americans a Nantucketer a Vineyarder a Cape man  Now it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we had biting Polar weather though all the time running away from it to the southward and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that merciless winter and all its intolerable weather behind us  It was one of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail foreboding shivers ran over me Reality outran apprehension Captain Ahab stood upon his quarterdeck  There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of the recovery from any  He looked like a man cut away from the stake when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness  His whole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an unalterable mould like Cellinis cast Perseus Threading its way out from among his grey hairs and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you saw a slender rodlike mark lividly whitish  It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it and without wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded  Whether that mark was born with him or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound no one could certainly say  By some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it especially by the mates  But once Tashtegos senior an old GayHead Indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea  Yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey Manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of Nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab  Nevertheless the old seatraditions the immemorial credulities popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment  So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid outwhich might hardly come to pass so he mutteredthen whoever should do that last office for the dead would find a birthmark on him from crown to sole  So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood  It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whales jaw  Aye he was dismasted off Japan said the old GayHead Indian once but like his dismasted craft he shipped another mast without coming home for it  He has a quiver of em  I was struck with the singular posture he maintained  Upon each side of the Pequods quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds there was an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the plank  His bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a shroud Captain Ahab stood erect looking straight out beyond the ships everpitching prow  There was an infinity of firmest fortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that glance  Not a word he spoke nor did his officers say aught to him though by all their minutest gestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful consciousness of being under a troubled mastereye  And not only that but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe  Ere long from his first visit in the air he withdrew into his cabin  But after that morning he was every day visible to the crew either standing in his pivothole or seated upon an ivory stool he had or heavily walking the deck  As the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as if when the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded  And by and by it came to pass that he was almost continually in the air but as yet for all that he said or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast  But the Pequod was only making a passage now not regularly cruising nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to so that there was little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite Ahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon  Nevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm him from his mood  For as when the redcheeked dancing girls April and May trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest ruggedest most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to welcome such gladhearted visitants so Ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air  More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look which in any other man would have soon flowered out in a smile CHAPTER 29  Enter Ahab to Him StubbSome days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring which at sea almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic  The warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing redundant days were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet heaped upflaked up with rosewater snow  The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their absent conquering Earls the golden helmeted suns  For sleeping man twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights  But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world  Inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mild hours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights  And all these subtle agencies more and more they wrought on Ahabs texture  Old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death  Among seacommanders the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the nightcloaked deck  It was so with Ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visits were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks  It feels like going down into ones tombhe would mutter to himselffor an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to my gravedug berth  So almost every twentyfour hours when the watches of the night were set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailors flung it not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch the cabinscuttle and ere long the old man would emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled way  Some considering touch of humanity was in him for at times like these he usually abstained from patrolling the quarterdeck because to his wearied mates seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks  But once the mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as with heavy lumberlike pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast Stubb the old second mate came up from below with a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay but there might be some way of muffling the noise hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the ivory heel  Ah  Stubb thou didst not know Ahab then  Am I a cannonball Stubb said Ahab that thou wouldst wad me that fashion  But go thy ways I had forgot  Below to thy nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling one at lastDown dog and kennel  Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man Stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedly I am not used to be spoken to that way sir I do but less than half like it sir  Avast gritted Ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away as if to avoid some passionate temptation  No sir not yet said Stubb emboldened I will not tamely be called a dog sir  Then be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass and begone or Ill clear the world of thee  As he said this Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect that Stubb involuntarily retreated  I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it muttered Stubb as he found himself descending the cabinscuttle Its very queer  Stop Stubb somehow now I dont well know whether to go back and strike him orwhats thatdown here on my knees and pray for him  Yes that was the thought coming up in me but it would be the first time I ever DID pray  Its queer very queer and hes queer too aye take him fore and aft hes about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with  How he flashed at mehis eyes like powderpans is he mad  Anyway theres something on his mind as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks He aint in his bed now either more than three hours out of the twentyfour and he dont sleep then  Didnt that DoughBoy the steward tell me that of a morning he always finds the old mans hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheets down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knots and the pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick had been on it  A hot old man  I guess hes got what some folks ashore call a conscience its a kind of TicDollyrow they sayworse nor a toothache  Well well I dont know what it is but the Lord keep me from catching it  Hes full of riddles I wonder what he goes into the after hold for every night as DoughBoy tells me he suspects whats that for I should like to know  Whos made appointments with him in the hold  Aint that queer now  But theres no telling its the old gameHere goes for a snooze  Damn me its worth a fellows while to be born into the world if only to fall right asleep  And now that I think of it thats about the first thing babies do and thats a sort of queer too  Damn me but all things are queer come to think of em But thats against my principles  Think not is my eleventh commandment and sleep when you can is my twelfthSo here goes again  But hows that didnt he call me a dog blazes he called me ten times a donkey and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT  He might as well have kicked me and done with it  Maybe he DID kick me and I didnt observe it I was so taken all aback with his brow somehow  It flashed like a bleached bone  What the devils the matter with me  I dont stand right on my legs  Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out  By the Lord I must have been dreaming thoughHow how howbut the only ways to stash it so here goes to hammock again and in the morning Ill see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight CHAPTER 30  The PipeWhen Stubb had departed Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks and then as had been usual with him of late calling a sailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe  Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck he sat and smoked  In old Norse times the thrones of the sealoving Danish kings were fabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale  How could one look at Ahab then seated on that tripod of bones without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized  For a Khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab  Some moments passed during which the thick vapour came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs which blew back again into his face How now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube this smoking no longer soothes  Oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone  Here have I been unconsciously toiling not pleasuringaye and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward and with such nervous whiffs as if like the dying whale my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble  What business have I with this pipe  This thing that is meant for sereneness to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs not among torn irongrey locks like mine  Ill smoke no more  He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea  The fire hissed in the waves the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made  With slouched hat Ahab lurchingly paced the planks CHAPTER 31  Queen MabNext morning Stubb accosted Flask  Such a queer dream KingPost I never had  You know the old mans ivory leg well I dreamed he kicked me with it and when I tried to kick back upon my soul my little man I kicked my leg right off And then presto  Ahab seemed a pyramid and I like a blazing fool kept kicking at it  But what was still more curious Flaskyou know how curious all dreams arethrough all this rage that I was in I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult that kick from Ahab  Why thinks I whats the row  Its not a real leg only a false leg  And theres a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump  Thats what makes a blow from the hand Flask fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane  The living memberthat makes the living insult my little man  And thinks I to myself all the while mind while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramidso confoundedly contradictory was it all all the while I say I was thinking to myself whats his leg now but a canea whalebone cane  Yes thinks I it was only a playful cudgellingin fact only a whaleboning that he gave menot a base kick  Besides thinks I look at it once why the end of itthe foot partwhat a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked me THERES a devilish broad insult  But this insult is whittled down to a point only  But now comes the greatest joke of the dream Flask While I was battering away at the pyramid a sort of badgerhaired old merman with a hump on his back takes me by the shoulders and slews me round  What are you bout says he  Slid man but I was frightened  Such a phiz  But somehow next moment I was over the fright  What am I about says I at last  And what business is that of yours I should like to know Mr Humpback  Do YOU want a kick  By the lord Flask I had no sooner said that than he turned round his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a cloutwhat do you think I sawwhy thunder alive man his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes with the points out  Says I on second thoughts I guess I wont kick you old fellow  Wise Stubb said he wise Stubb and kept muttering it all the time a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag  Seeing he wasnt going to stop saying over his wise Stubb wise Stubb I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again  But I had only just lifted my foot for it when he roared out Stop that kicking Halloa says I whats the matter now old fellow  Look ye here says he lets argue the insult  Captain Ahab kicked ye didnt he  Yes he did says Iright HERE it was  Very good says hehe used his ivory leg didnt he  Yes he did says I  Well then says he wise Stubb what have you to complain of  Didnt he kick with right good will it wasnt a common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it  No you were kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg Stubb  Its an honour I consider it an honour  Listen wise Stubb  In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made garterknights of but be YOUR boast Stubb that ye were kicked by old Ahab and made a wise man of  Remember what I say BE kicked by him account his kicks honours and on no account kick back for you cant help yourself wise Stubb  Dont you see that pyramid  With that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air  I snored rolled over and there I was in my hammock  Now what do you think of that dream Flask  I dont know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho  May be may be  But its made a wise man of me Flask  Dye see Ahab standing there sideways looking over the stern  Well the best thing you can do Flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him whatever he says  Halloa  Whats that he shouts  Hark  Masthead there  Look sharp all of ye  There are whales hereabouts  If ye see a white one split your lungs for him  What do you think of that now Flask aint there a small drop of something queer about that eh  A white whaledid ye mark that man  Look yetheres something special in the wind  Stand by for it Flask  Ahab has that thats bloody on his mind  But mum he comes this way CHAPTER 32  CetologyAlready we are boldly launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost in its unshored harbourless immensities  Ere that come to pass ere the Pequods weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow  It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera that I would now fain put before you  Yet is it no easy task  The classification of the constituents of a chaos nothing less is here essayed  Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down  No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology says Captain Scoresby AD 1820  It is not my intention were it in my power to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families  Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal sperm whale says Surgeon Beale AD 1839  Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea  A field strewn with thorns  All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists  Thus speak of the whale the great Cuvier and John Hunter and Lesson those lights of zoology and anatomy  Nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of books there are a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of whales Many are the men small and great old and new landsmen and seamen who have at large or in little written of the whale  Run over a fewThe Authors of the Bible Aristotle Pliny Aldrovandi Sir Thomas Browne Gesner Ray Linnaeus Rondeletius Willoughby Green Artedi Sibbald Brisson Marten Lacepede Bonneterre Desmarest Baron Cuvier Frederick Cuvier John Hunter Owen Scoresby Beale Bennett J  Ross Browne the Author of Miriam Coffin Olmstead and the Rev  T  Cheever  But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written the above cited extracts will show  Of the names in this list of whale authors only those following Owen ever saw living whales and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman  I mean Captain Scoresby  On the separate subject of the Greenland or rightwhale he is the best existing authority  But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning  And here be it said that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas  He is not even by any means the largest of the whales  Yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown spermwhale and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whaleports this usurpation has been every way complete  Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days will satisfy you that the Greenland whale without one rival was to them the monarch of the seas  But the time has at last come for a new proclamation  This is Charing Cross hear ye good people allthe Greenland whale is deposedthe great sperm whale now reigneth  There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt  Those books are Beales and Bennetts both in their time surgeons to English SouthSea whaleships and both exact and reliable men  The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality though mostly confined to scientific description  As yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic lives not complete in any literature  Far above all other hunted whales his is an unwritten life  Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers  As no better man advances to take this matter in hand I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors  I promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty  I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species orin this place at leastto much of any description  My object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology  I am the architect not the builder  But it is a ponderous task no ordinary lettersorter in the PostOffice is equal to it  To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them to have ones hands among the unspeakable foundations ribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing  What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan  The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me  Will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee  Behold the hope of him is vain  But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans I have had to do with whales with these visible hands I am in earnest and I will try  There are some preliminaries to settle  First The uncertain unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish  In his System of Nature AD 1776 Linnaeus declares I hereby separate the whales from the fish  But of my own knowledge I know that down to the year 1850 sharks and shad alewives and herring against Linnaeuss express edict were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan  The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters he states as follows On account of their warm bilocular heart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege naturae jure meritoque  I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin of Nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient  Charley profanely hinted they were humbug  Be it known that waiving all argument I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy Jonah to back me This fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish  Above Linnaeus has given you those items  But in brief they are these lungs and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded  Next how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come  To be short then a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL  There you have him  However contracted that definition is the result of expanded meditation  A walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not a fish because he is amphibious  But the last term of the definition is still more cogent as coupled with the first  Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat but a vertical or upanddown tail  Whereas among spouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontal position  By the above definition of what a whale is I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers nor on the other hand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien  Hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this groundplan of Cetology  Now then come the grand divisions of the entire whale hostI am aware that down to the present time the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs Pigfish and Sowfish of the Coffins of Nantucket are included by many naturalists among the whales  But as these pigfish are a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet hay and especially as they do not spout I deny their credentials as whales and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of CetologyFirst According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS subdivisible into CHAPTERS and these shall comprehend them all both small and large  I THE FOLIO WHALE II the OCTAVO WHALE III the DUODECIMO WHALE  As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE of the OCTAVO the GRAMPUS of the DUODECIMO the PORPOISE  FOLIOS  Among these I here include the following chaptersI The SPERM WHALE II the RIGHT WHALE III the FINBACK WHALE IV the HUMPBACKED WHALE V the RAZORBACK WHALE VI the SULPHURBOTTOM WHALE  BOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER I SPERM WHALEThis whale among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale and the Physeter whale and the Anvil Headed whale is the present Cachalot of the French and the Pottsfich of the Germans and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words  He is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti is obtained  All his peculiarities will in many other places be enlarged upon  It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do  Philologically considered it is absurd  Some centuries ago when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish in those days spermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale  It was the idea also that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses  In those times also spermaceti was exceedingly scarce not being used for light but only as an ointment and medicament  It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb  When as I opine in the course of time the true nature of spermaceti became known its original name was still retained by the dealers no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity  And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived  BOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER II RIGHT WHALEIn one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularly hunted by man  It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known as whale oil an inferior article in commerce  Among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles The Whale the Greenland Whale the Black Whale the Great Whale the True Whale the Right Whale  There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised  What then is the whale which I include in the second species of my Folios  It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes  It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean on the Brazil Banks on the Nor West Coast and various other parts of the world designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds  Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans  But they precisely agree in all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate  The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whale  BOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER III FINBACKUnder this head I reckon a monster which by the various names of FinBack TallSpout and LongJohn has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic in the New York packettracks  In the length he attains and in his baleen the Finback resembles the right whale but is of a less portly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive  His great lips present a cablelike aspect formed by the intertwisting slanting folds of large wrinkles  His grand distinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object  This fin is some three or four feet long growing vertically from the hinder part of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end  Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will at times be seen plainly projecting from the surface  When the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with spherical ripples and this gnomonlike fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavy hourlines graved on it  On that Ahazdial the shadow often goes back  The FinBack is not gregarious  He seems a whalehater as some men are manhaters  Very shy always going solitary unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming as to defy all present pursuit from man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race bearing for his mark that style upon his back  From having the baleen in his mouth the FinBack is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES that is whales with baleen  Of these so called Whalebone whales there would seem to be several varieties most of which however are little known  Broadnosed whales and beaked whales pikeheaded whales bunched whales underjawed whales and rostrated whales are the fishermens names for a few sorts  In connection with this appellative of Whalebone whales it is of great importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan founded upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions which the whale in his kinds presents  How then  The baleen hump backfin and teeth these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars  Thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases  Then this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale each of these has baleen but there again the similitude ceases  And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned  In various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations or in the case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis  On this rock every one of the whalenaturalists has split  But it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of the whale in his anatomythere at least we shall be able to hit the right classification  Nay what thing for example is there in the Greenland whales anatomy more striking than his baleen  Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale  And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated  What then remains nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way  And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can possibly succeed for it alone is practicable  To proceed  BOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER IV HUMPBACKThis whale is often seen on the northern American coast  He has been frequently captured there and towed into harbor  He has a great pack on him like a peddler or you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale  At any rate the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one  His oil is not very valuable  He has baleen  He is the most gamesome and lighthearted of all the whales making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them  BOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER V RAZORBACKOf this whale little is known but his name  I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn  Of a retiring nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers  Though no coward he has never yet shown any part of him but his back which rises in a long sharp ridge  Let him go  I know little more of him nor does anybody else  BOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER VI SULPHURBOTTOMAnother retiring gentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings  He is seldom seen at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance  He is never chased he would run away with ropewalks of line  Prodigies are told of him  Adieu Sulphur Bottom  I can say nothing more that is true of ye nor can the oldest Nantucketer  Thus ends BOOK I FOLIO and now begins BOOK II OCTAVO  OCTAVOESThese embrace the whales of middling magnitude among which present may be numberedI the GRAMPUS II the BLACK FISH III the NARWHALE IV the THRASHER V the KILLERWhy this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain Because while the whales of this order though smaller than those of the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure yet the bookbinders Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume but the Octavo volume doesBOOK II OCTAVO CHAPTER I GRAMPUSThough this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has furnished a proverb to landsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not popularly classed among whales  But possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan most naturalists have recognised him for one  He is of moderate octavo size varying from fifteen to twentyfive feet in length and of corresponding dimensions round the waist  He swims in herds he is never regularly hunted though his oil is considerable in quantity and pretty good for light  By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale  BOOK II OCTAVO CHAPTER II BLACK FISHI give the popular fishermens names for all these fish for generally they are the best  Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive I shall say so and suggest another  I do so now touching the Black Fish socalled because blackness is the rule among almost all whales So call him the Hyena Whale if you please  His voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face  This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length  He is found in almost all latitudes  He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which looks something like a Roman nose  When not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employmentas some frugal housekeepers in the absence of company and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax  Though their blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil  BOOK II OCTAVO CHAPTER III NARWHALE that is NOSTRIL WHALEAnother instance of a curiously named whale so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose  The creature is some sixteen feet in length while its horn averages five feet though some exceed ten and even attain to fifteen feet  Strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal  But it is only found on the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy lefthanded man  What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers it would be hard to say  It does not seem to be used like the blade of the swordfish and billfish though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food  Charley Coffin said it was used for an icepiercer for the Narwhale rising to the surface of the Polar Sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrusts his horn up and so breaks through  But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct  My own opinion is that however this onesided horn may really be used by the Narwhalehowever that may beit would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets  The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale the Horned whale and the Unicorn whale  He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature  From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same seaunicorns horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison and as such preparations of it brought immense prices  It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn  Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity  Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace as his bold ship sailed down the Thames when Sir Martin returned from that voyage saith Black Letter on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor  An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester on bended knees did likewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature  The Narwhale has a very picturesque leopardlike look being of a milkwhite ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of black His oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted  He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas  BOOK II OCTAVO CHAPTER IV KILLEROf this whale little is precisely known to the Nantucketer and nothing at all to the professed naturalist  From what I have seen of him at a distance I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus  He is very savagea sort of Feegee fish  He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip and hangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death  The Killer is never hunted  I never heard what sort of oil he has  Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indistinctness  For we are all killers on land and on sea Bonapartes and Sharks included  BOOK II OCTAVO CHAPTER V THRASHERThis gentleman is famous for his tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes  He mounts the Folio whales back and as he swims he works his passage by flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process  Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer  Both are outlaws even in the lawless seas  Thus ends BOOK II OCTAVO and begins BOOK III DUODECIMO  DUODECIMOESThese include the smaller whales  I The Huzza Porpoise  II The Algerine Porpoise  III The Mealymouthed Porpoise  To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALESa word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness  But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of my definition of what a whale isie a spouting fish with a horizontal tail  BOOK III DUODECIMO CHAPTER 1 HUZZA PORPOISEThis is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe  The name is of my own bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises and something must be done to distinguish them  I call him thus because he always swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a FourthofJuly crowd Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner Full of fine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward  They are the lads that always live before the wind  They are accounted a lucky omen  If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye  A wellfed plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil  But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers  Sailors put it on their hones  Porpoise meat is good eating you know  It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts  Indeed his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible  But the next time you have a chance watch him and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature  BOOK III DUODECIMO CHAPTER II ALGERINE PORPOISEA pirate Very savage  He is only found I think in the Pacific  He is somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise but much of the same general make  Provoke him and he will buckle to a shark  I have lowered for him many times but never yet saw him captured  BOOK III DUODECIMO CHAPTER III MEALYMOUTHED PORPOISEThe largest kind of Porpoise and only found in the Pacific so far as it is known  The only English name by which he has hitherto been designated is that of the fishersRightWhale Porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio In shape he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of quite a neat and gentlemanlike figure  He has no fins on his back most other porpoises have he has a lovely tail and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue  But his mealymouth spoils all  Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in a ships hull called the bright waist that line streaks him from stem to stern with two separate colours black above and white below  The white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a mealbag  A most mean and mealy aspect  His oil is much like that of the common porpoiseBeyond the DUODECIMO this system does not proceed inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales  Above you have all the Leviathans of note  But there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive halffabulous whales which as an American whaleman I know by reputation but not personally  I shall enumerate them by their forecastle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators who may complete what I have here but begun If any of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then he can readily be incorporated into this System according to his Folio Octavo or Duodecimo magnitudeThe BottleNose Whale the Junk Whale the PuddingHeaded Whale the Cape Whale the Leading Whale the Cannon Whale the Scragg Whale the Coppered Whale the Elephant Whale the Iceberg Whale the Quog Whale the Blue Whale etc From Icelandic Dutch and old English authorities there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names  But I omit them as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds full of Leviathanism but signifying nothing  Finally It was stated at the outset that this system would not be here and at once perfected  You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word  But I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower  For small erections may be finished by their first architects grand ones true ones ever leave the copestone to posterity  God keep me from ever completing anything  This whole book is but a draughtnay but the draught of a draught  Oh Time Strength Cash and Patience CHAPTER 33  The SpecksynderConcerning the officers of the whalecraft this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipboard arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whalefleet  The large importance attached to the harpooneers vocation is evinced by the fact that originally in the old Dutch Fishery two centuries and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksynder  Literally this word means FatCutter usage however in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer  In those days the captains authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel while over the whalehunting department and all its concerns the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme  In the British Greenland Fishery under the corrupted title of Specksioneer this old Dutch official is still retained but his former dignity is sadly abridged  At present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer and as such is but one of the captains more inferior subalterns  Nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat but under certain circumstances night watches on a whaling ground the command of the ships deck is also his therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior though always by them familiarly regarded as their social equal  Now the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea is thisthe first lives aft the last forward  Hence in whaleships and merchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain and so too in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship  That is to say they take their meals in the captains cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it  Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar perils of it and the community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom high or low depend for their profits not upon fixed wages but upon their common luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and hard work though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some primitive instances live together for all that the punctilious externals at least of the quarterdeck are seldom materially relaxed and in no instance done away  Indeed many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarterdeck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilotcloth  And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage he ever exacted was implicit instantaneous obedience though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarterdeck and though there were times when owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed he addressed them in unusual terms whether of condescension or IN TERROREM or otherwise yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea  Nor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behind those forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himself incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve  That certain sultanism of his brain which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship  For be a mans intellectual superiority what it will it can never assume the practical available supremacy over other men without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments always in themselves more or less paltry and base  This it is that for ever keeps Gods true princes of the Empire from the worlds hustings and leaves the highest honours that this air can give to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass  Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency But when as in the case of Nicholas the Czar the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization  Nor will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art as the one now alluded to  But Ahab my Captain still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whalehunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me  Oh Ahab what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air CHAPTER 34  The CabinTableIt is noon and DoughBoy the steward thrusting his pale loafofbread face from the cabinscuttle announces dinner to his lord and master who sitting in the lee quarterboat has just been taking an observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth medallionshaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg  From his complete inattention to the tidings you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial  But presently catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying Dinner Mr Starbuck disappears into the cabin  When the last echo of his sultans step has died away and Starbuck the first Emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated then Starbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along the planks and after a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch of pleasantness Dinner Mr Stubb and descends the scuttle The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right with that important rope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid Dinner Mr Flask follows after his predecessors  But the third Emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarterdeck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off his shoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turks head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck reversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with music But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little Flask enters King Ahabs presence in the character of Abjectus or the Slave  It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of seausages that while in the open air of the deck some officers will upon provocation bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commanders cabin and straightway their inoffensive not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical  Wherefore this difference  A problem  Perhaps not  To have been Belshazzar King of Babylon and to have been Belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur  But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinnertable of invited guests that mans unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time that mans royalty of state transcends Belshazzars for Belshazzar was not the greatest  Who has but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be Caesar  It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding  Now if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a shipmaster then by inference you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sealife just mentioned  Over his ivoryinlaid table Ahab presided like a mute maned sealion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs  In his own proper turn each officer waited to be served  They were as little children before Ahab and yet in Ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance  With one mind their intent eyes all fastened upon the old mans knife as he carved the chief dish before him  I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even upon so neutral a topic as the weather  No  And when reaching out his knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked Ahab thereby motioned Starbucks plate towards him the mate received his meat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection  For like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort where the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb  What a relief it was to choking Stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below  And poor little Flask he was the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party  His were the shinbones of the saline beef his would have been the drumsticks  For Flask to have presumed to help himself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree  Had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say Ahab never forbade him  And had Flask helped himself the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it  Least of all did Flask presume to help himself to butter Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account of its clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long a voyage in such marketless waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not for him a subaltern however it was Flask alas was a butterless man  Another thing  Flask was the last person down at the dinner and Flask is the first man up  Consider  For hereby Flasks dinner was badly jammed in point of time  Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear If Stubb even who is but a peg higher than Flask happens to have but a small appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then Flask must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry more or less  For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him  Peace and satisfaction thought Flask have for ever departed from my stomach I am an officer but how I wish I could fish a bit of oldfashioned beef in the forecastle as I used to when I was before the mast Theres the fruits of promotion now theres the vanity of glory theres the insanity of life  Besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flasks official capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance was to go aft at dinnertime and get a peep at Flask through the cabin skylight sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab  Now Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pequods cabin  After their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward  And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being its residuary legatees  They made a sort of temporary servants hall of the high and mighty cabin  In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captains table was the entire carefree license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers  While their masters the mates seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it  They dined like lords they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices  Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast often the pale DoughBoy was fain to bring on a great baron of saltjunk seemingly quarried out of the solid ox And if he were not lively about it if he did not go with a nimble hopskipandjump then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoonwise  And once Daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted DoughBoys memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher while Tashtego knife in hand began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him  He was naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow this breadfaced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse  And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages DoughBoys whole life was one continual lipquiver  Commonly after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door till all was over  It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego opposing his filed teeth to the Indians crosswise to them Daggoo seated on the floor for a bench would have brought his hearseplumed head to the low carlines at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low cabin framework to shake as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship  But for all this the great negro was wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty  It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad baronial and superb a person But doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds  Not by beef or by bread are giants made or nourished  But Queequeg he had a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eatingan ugly sound enoughso much so that the trembling DoughBoy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms  And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself that his bones might be picked the simplewitted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy  Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for their lances and other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor DoughBoy  How could he forget that in his Island days Queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of some murderous convivial indiscretions  Alas  DoughBoy hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals  Not a napkin should he carry on his arm but a buckler  In good time though to his great delight the three saltsea warriors would rise and depart to his credulous fablemongering ears all their martial bones jingling in them at every step like Moorish scimetars in scabbards  But though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominally lived there still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and just before sleepingtime when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters  In this one matter Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ships cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is at any time permitted there  So that in real truth the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it  For when they did enter it it was something as a streetdoor enters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turned out the next and as a permanent thing residing in the open air  Nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin was no companionship socially Ahab was inaccessible  Though nominally included in the census of Christendom he was still an alien to it  He lived in the world as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri  And as when Spring and Summer had departed that wild Logan of the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old age Ahabs soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom CHAPTER 35  The MastHeadIt was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the other seamen my first masthead came round  In most American whalemen the mastheads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessels leaving her port even though she may have fifteen thousand miles and more to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground  And if after a three four or five years voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in hersay an empty vial eventhen her mastheads are kept manned to the last and not till her skysailpoles sail in among the spires of the port does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more  Now as the business of standing mastheads ashore or afloat is a very ancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiate here  I take it that the earliest standers of mastheads were the old Egyptians because in all my researches I find none prior to them  For though their progenitors the builders of Babel must doubtless by their tower have intended to rear the loftiest masthead in all Asia or Africa either yet ere the final truck was put to it as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread gale of Gods wrath therefore we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians  And that the Egyptians were a nation of masthead standers is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stairlike formation of all four sides of those edifices whereby with prodigious long upliftings of their legs those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars even as the lookouts of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight  In Saint Stylites the famous Christian hermit of old times who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless standerofmastheads who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiantly facing everything out to the last literally died at his post  Of modern standersofmastheads we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight  There is Napoleon who upon the top of the column of Vendome stands with arms folded some one hundred and fifty feet in the air careless now who rules the decks below whether Louis Philippe Louis Blanc or Louis the Devil  Great Washington too stands high aloft on his towering mainmast in Baltimore and like one of Hercules pillars his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go  Admiral Nelson also on a capstan of gunmetal stands his masthead in Trafalgar Square and ever when most obscured by that London smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there is smoke must be fire  But neither great Washington nor Napoleon nor Nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze however it may be surmised that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned  It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the masthead standers of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not so is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy the sole historian of Nantucket stands accountable  The worthy Obed tells us that in the early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erected lofty spars along the seacoast to which the lookouts ascended by means of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a henhouse  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the readymanned boats nigh the beach  But this custom has now become obsolete turn we then to the one proper masthead that of a whaleship at sea  The three mastheads are kept manned from sunrise to sunset the seamen taking their regular turns as at the helm and relieving each other every two hours  In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the masthead nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful  There you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks striding along the deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes There you stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with nothing ruffled but the waves  The tranced ship indolently rolls the drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you into languor  For the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness invests you you hear no news read no gazettes extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements you hear of no domestic afflictions bankrupt securities fall of stocks are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinnerfor all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks and your bill of fare is immutable  In one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four years voyage as often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the masthead would amount to several entire months  And it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves  Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t gallantmast where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks almost peculiar to whalemen called the t gallant crosstrees  Here tossed about by the sea the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bulls horns  To be sure in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape of a watchcoat but properly speaking the thickest watchcoat is no more of a house than the unclad body for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle and cannot freely move about in it nor even move out of it without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter so a watchcoat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you  You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watchcoat  Concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mastheads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits called CROWSNESTS in which the lookouts of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas  In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet entitled A Voyage among the Icebergs in quest of the Greenland Whale and incidentally for the rediscovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland in this admirable volume all standers of mastheads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented CROWSNEST of the Glacier which was the name of Captain Sleets good craft  He called it the SLEETS CROWSNEST in honour of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children after our own names we fathers being the original inventors and patentees so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget  In shape the Sleets crowsnest is something like a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with a movable sidescreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale  Being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a little traphatch in the bottom  On the after side or side next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrellas comforters and coats  In front is a leather rack in which to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope and other nautical conveniences  When Captain Sleet in person stood his masthead in this crowsnest of his he tells us that he always had a rifle with him also fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing  Now it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe as he does all the little detailed conveniences of his crowsnest but though he so enlarges upon many of these and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crowsnest with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the local attraction of all binnacle magnets an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ships planks and in the Glaciers case perhaps to there having been so many brokendown blacksmiths among her crew I say that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here yet for all his learned binnacle deviations azimuth compass observations and approximate errors he knows very well Captain Sleet that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little casebottle so nicely tucked in on one side of his crows nest within easy reach of his hand  Though upon the whole I greatly admire and even love the brave the honest and learned Captain yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that casebottle seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that birds nest within three or four perches of the pole  But if we Southern whalefishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float  For one I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg or any one else off duty whom I might find there then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the topsail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and so at last mount to my ultimate destination  Let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that I kept but sorry guard  With the problem of the universe revolving in me how could Ibeing left completely to myself at such a thoughtengendering altitudehow could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whaleships standing orders Keep your weather eye open and sing out every time  And let me in this place movingly admonish you ye shipowners of Nantucket  Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head  Beware of such an one I say your whales must be seen before they can be killed and this sunkeneyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer  Nor are these monitions at all unneeded  For nowadays the whalefishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absentminded young men disgusted with the carking cares of earth and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber  Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the masthead of some luckless disappointed whaleship and in moody phrase ejaculates  Roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll  Ten thousand blubberhunters sweep over thee in vain  Very often do the captains of such ships take those absentminded young philosophers to task upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient interest in the voyage halfhinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise  But all in vain those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect they are shortsighted what use then to strain the visual nerve  They have left their operaglasses at home  Why thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lads weve been cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whale yet  Whales are scarce as hens teeth whenever thou art up here  Perhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon but lulled into such an opiumlike listlessness of vacant unconscious reverie is this absentminded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses his identity takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep blue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every strange halfseen gliding beautiful thing that eludes him every dimlydiscovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it  In this enchanted mood thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came becomes diffused through time and space like Crammers sprinkled Pantheistic ashes forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over  There is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from the inscrutable tides of God  But while this sleep this dream is on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your identity comes back in horror  Over Descartian vortices you hover And perhaps at midday in the fairest weather with one halfthrottled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise for ever  Heed it well ye Pantheists CHAPTER 36  The QuarterDeckENTER AHAB THEN ALLIt was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast Ahab as was his wont ascended the cabingangway to the deck  There most seacaptains usually walk at that hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns in the garden  Soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all over dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk  Did you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger footprintsthe footprints of his one unsleeping everpacing thought  But on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark  And so full of his thought was Ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the mainmast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement  Dye mark him Flask whispered Stubb the chick thats in him pecks the shell  Twill soon be out  The hours wore onAhab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect  It drew near the close of day  Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the augerhole there and with one hand grasping a shroud he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft  Sir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on shipboard except in some extraordinary case  Send everybody aft repeated Ahab  Mastheads there come down  When the entire ships company were assembled and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up Ahab after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks and then darting his eyes among the crew started from his standpoint and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck  With bent head and halfslouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat  But this did not last long  Vehemently pausing he cried  What do ye do when ye see a whale men  Sing out for him was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices  Good cried Ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them  And what do ye next men  Lower away and after him  And what tune is it ye pull to men  A dead whale or a stove boat  More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions  But they were all eagerness again as Ahab now halfrevolving in his pivothole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus  All ye mastheaders have before now heard me give orders about a white whale  Look ye dye see this Spanish ounce of goldholding up a broad bright coin to the sunit is a sixteen dollar piece men  Dye see it  Mr Starbuck hand me yon topmaul  While the mate was getting the hammer Ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him  Receiving the topmaul from Starbuck he advanced towards the mainmast with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming Whosoever of ye raises me a whiteheaded whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of ye raises me that whiteheaded whale with three holes punctured in his starboard flukelook ye whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys  Huzza huzza cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast  Its a white whale I say resumed Ahab as he threw down the topmaul a white whale  Skin your eyes for him men look sharp for white water if ye see but a bubble sing out  All this while Tashtego Daggoo and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection  Captain Ahab said Tashtego that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick  Moby Dick shouted Ahab  Do ye know the white whale then Tash  Does he fantail a little curious sir before he goes down said the GayHeader deliberately  And has he a curious spout too said Daggoo very bushy even for a parmacetty and mighty quick Captain Ahab  And he have one two threeoh good many iron in him hide too Captain cried Queequeg disjointedly all twisketee betwisk like himhim faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottlelike himhim  Corkscrew cried Ahab aye Queequeg the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him aye Daggoo his spout is a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheepshearing aye Tashtego and he fantails like a split jib in a squall  Death and devils men it is Moby Dick ye have seenMoby DickMoby Dick  Captain Ahab said Starbuck who with Stubb and Flask had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder Captain Ahab I have heard of Moby Dickbut it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg  Who told thee that cried Ahab then pausing Aye Starbuck aye my hearties all round it was Moby Dick that dismasted me Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now  Aye aye he shouted with a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heartstricken moose Aye aye it was that accursed white whale that razeed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day Then tossing both arms with measureless imprecations he shouted out Aye aye and Ill chase him round Good Hope and round the Horn and round the Norway Maelstrom and round perditions flames before I give him up  And this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out  What say ye men will ye splice hands on it now  I think ye do look brave  Aye aye shouted the harpooneers and seamen running closer to the excited old man A sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for Moby Dick  God bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout  God bless ye men  Steward go draw the great measure of grog  But whats this long face about Mr Starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not game for Moby Dick  I am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of Death too Captain Ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow but I came here to hunt whales not my commanders vengeance How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it Captain Ahab it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market  Nantucket market  Hoot  But come closer Starbuck thou requirest a little lower layer  If moneys to be the measurer man and the accountants have computed their great countinghouse the globe by girdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE  He smites his chest whispered Stubb whats that for methinks it rings most vast but hollow  Vengeance on a dumb brute cried Starbuck that simply smote thee from blindest instinct  Madness  To be enraged with a dumb thing Captain Ahab seems blasphemous  Hark ye yet againthe little lower layer  All visible objects man are but as pasteboard masks  But in each eventin the living act the undoubted deedthere some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask  If man will strike strike through the mask  How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall To me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me  Sometimes I think theres naught beyond  But tis enough  He tasks me he heaps me I see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice sinewing it  That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale principal I will wreak that hate upon him  Talk not to me of blasphemy man Id strike the sun if it insulted me  For could the sun do that then could I do the other since there is ever a sort of fair play herein jealousy presiding over all creations  But not my master man is even that fair play  Whos over me  Truth hath no confines  Take off thine eye more intolerable than fiends glarings is a doltish stare  So so thou reddenest and palest my heat has melted thee to angerglow But look ye Starbuck what is said in heat that thing unsays itself  There are men from whom warm words are small indignity  I meant not to incense thee  Let it go  Look see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawnliving breathing pictures painted by the sun  The Pagan leopardsthe unrecking and unworshipping things that live and seek and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel  The crew man the crew  Are they not one and all with Ahab in this matter of the whale  See Stubb he laughs  See yonder Chilian he snorts to think of it  Stand up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling cannot Starbuck  And what is it Reckon it  Tis but to help strike a fin no wondrous feat for Starbuck  What is it more  From this one poor hunt then the best lance out of all Nantucket surely he will not hang back when every foremasthand has clutched a whetstone  Ah constrainings seize thee I see the billow lifts thee  Speak but speakAye aye thy silence then THAT voices thee  ASIDE Something shot from my dilated nostrils he has inhaled it in his lungs  Starbuck now is mine cannot oppose me now without rebellion  God keep mekeep us all murmured Starbuck lowly  But in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts as for a moment their hearts sank in  For again Starbucks downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life the subterranean laugh died away the winds blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and rolled as before  Ah ye admonitions and warnings why stay ye not when ye come  But rather are ye predictions than warnings ye shadows  Yet not so much predictions from without as verifications of the foregoing things within  For with little external to constrain us the innermost necessities in our being these still drive us on  The measure the measure cried Ahab  Receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers he ordered them to produce their weapons  Then ranging them before him near the capstan with their harpoons in their hands while his three mates stood at his side with their lances and the rest of the ships company formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew  But those wild eyes met his as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison but alas only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian  Drink and pass he cried handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman  The crew alone now drink  Round with it round Short draughtslong swallows men tis hot as Satans hoof  So so it goes round excellently  It spiralizes in ye forks out at the serpentsnapping eye  Well done almost drained  That way it went this way it comes  Hand it meheres a hollow  Men ye seem the years so brimming life is gulped and gone  Steward refill  Attend now my braves  I have mustered ye all round this capstan and ye mates flank me with your lances and ye harpooneers stand there with your irons and ye stout mariners ring me in that I may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me  O men you will yet see thatHa boy come back bad pennies come not sooner  Hand it me  Why now this pewter had run brimming again weret not thou St Vitus impaway thou ague  Advance ye mates  Cross your lances full before me  Well done Let me touch the axis  So saying with extended arm he grasped the three level radiating lances at their crossed centre while so doing suddenly and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb from Stubb to Flask  It seemed as though by some nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life  The three mates quailed before his strong sustained and mystic aspect  Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright  In vain cried Ahab but maybe tis well  For did ye three but once take the fullforced shock then mine own electric thing THAT had perhaps expired from out me  Perchance too it would have dropped ye dead  Perchance ye need it not  Down lances  And now ye mates I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen thereyon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen my valiant harpooneers  Disdain the task  What when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars using his tiara for ewer  Oh my sweet cardinals your own condescension THAT shall bend ye to it  I do not order ye ye will it  Cut your seizings and draw the poles ye harpooneers  Silently obeying the order the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons some three feet long held barbs up before him  Stab me not with that keen steel  Cant them cant them over know ye not the goblet end  Turn up the socket  So so now ye cupbearers advance  The irons take them hold them while I fill Forthwith slowly going from one officer to the other he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter  Now three to three ye stand  Commend the murderous chalices Bestow them ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league Ha  Starbuck but the deed is done  Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it  Drink ye harpooneers drink and swear ye men that man the deathful whaleboats bowDeath to Moby Dick  God hunt us all if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death  The long barbed steel goblets were lifted and to cries and maledictions against the white whale the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss Starbuck paled and turned and shivered  Once more and finally the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew when waving his free hand to them they all dispersed and Ahab retired within his cabin CHAPTER 37  SunsetTHE CABIN BY THE STERN WINDOWS AHAB SITTING ALONE AND GAZING OUTI leave a white and turbid wake pale waters paler cheeks whereer I sail  The envious billows

Good nightgood night WAVING HIS HAND HE MOVES FROM THE WINDOW  Twas not so hard a task  I thought to find one stubborn at the least but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels and they

it pictures life  Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay embattled bantering bow but only to drag dark Ahab after it where he broods within his sternward cabin builded over the dead water of the wake and further on hunted by its wolfish gurglings  The long howl thrills me through  Peace ye revellers and set the watch Oh life  tis in an hour like this with soul beat down and held

more did I hammer and clinch my oath because of the dread in my soul  A wild mystical sympathetical feeling was in me Ahabs quenchless feud seemed mine  With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge  For some time past though at intervals only the unaccompanied secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen  But not all of them knew of his existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seen him while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him was small indeed  For owing to the large number of whalecruisers the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch to encounter a single newstelling sail of any sort the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the times of sailing from home all these with other circumstances direct and indirect long obstructed the spread through the whole worldwide whalingfleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick  It was hardly to be doubted that several vessels reported to have encountered at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after doing great mischief to his assailants had completely escaped them to some minds it was not an unfair presumption I say that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick  Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monster attacked therefore it was that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick such hunters perhaps for the most part were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more as it were to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large than to the individual cause  In that way mostly the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded  And as for those who previously hearing of the White Whale by chance caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him as for any other whale of that species  But at length such calamities did ensue in these assaultsnot restricted to sprained wrists and ankles broken limbs or devouring amputationsbut fatal to the last degree of fatality those repeated disastrous repulses all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come  Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters  For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible eventsas the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumors abound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to  And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there  For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels but hand to jaw give battle to them  Alone in such remotest waters that though you sailed a thousand miles and passed a thousand shores you would not come to any chiseled hearthstone or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing too such a calling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth  No wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and halfformed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears  So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the White Whale few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw  But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work  Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body  There are those this day among them who though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale would perhapseither from professional inexperience or incompetency or timidity decline a contest with the Sperm Whale at any rate there are plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North seated on their hatches these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe to the wild strange tales of Southern whaling  Nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prows which stem him  And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it we find some book naturalistsOlassen and Povelsondeclaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuviers were these or almost similar impressions effaced  For in his Natural History the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale all fish sharks included are struck with the most lively terrors and often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death  And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these yet in their full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson the superstitious belief in them is in some vicissitudes of their vocation revived in the minds of the hunters  So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him not a few of the fishermen recalled in reference to Moby Dick the earlier days of the Sperm Whale fishery when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man That to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity  On this head there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted  Nevertheless some there were who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to Moby Dick and a still greater number who chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without the specific details of any certain calamity and without superstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered  One of the wild suggestions referred to as at last coming to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time  Nor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability  For as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged even to the most erudite research so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to his pursuers and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them especially concerning the mystic modes whereby after sounding to a great depth he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points  It is a thing well known to both American and English whaleships and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas  Nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days Hence by inference it has been believed by some whalemen that the Nor West Passage so long a problem to man was never a problem to the whale  So that here in the real living experience of living men the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen  Forced into familiarity then with such prodigies as these and knowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the White Whale had escaped alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity in time that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks he would still swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsullied jet would once more be seen  But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power  For it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales but as was elsewhere thrown outa peculiar snowwhite wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump  These were his prominent features the tokens whereby even in the limitless uncharted seas he revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him  The rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale a name indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea leaving a milkyway wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden gleamings  Nor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his deformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror as that unexampled intelligent malignity which according to specific accounts he had over and over again evinced in his assaults  More than all his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else  For when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm he had several times been known to turn round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave their boats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship  Already several fatalities had attended his chase  But though similar disasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the White Whales infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent  Judge then to what pitches of inflamed distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips of chewed boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the white curds of the whales direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal  His three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling in the eddies one captain seizing the lineknife from his broken prow had dashed at the whale as an Arkansas duellist at his foe blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathomdeep life of the whale  That captain was Ahab  And then it was that suddenly sweeping his sickleshaped lower jaw beneath him Moby Dick had reaped away Ahabs leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field  No turbaned Turk no hired Venetian or Malay could have smote him with more seeming malice  Small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations  The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung  That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe onehalf of the worlds which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devilAhab did not fall down and worship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it  All that most maddens and torments all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with malice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain all the subtle demonisms of life and thought all evil to crazy Ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in Moby Dick  He piled upon the whales white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down and then as if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot hearts shell upon it  It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment  Then in darting at the monster knife in hand he had but given loose to a sudden passionate corporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more  Yet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and for long months of days and weeks Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling Patagonian Cape then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another and so interfusing made him mad That it was only then on the homeward voyage after the encounter that the final monomania seized him seems all but certain from the fact that at intervals during the passage he was a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of a leg yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest and was moreover intensified by his delirium that his mates were forced to lace him fast even there as he sailed raving in his hammock  In a straitjacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gales  And when running into more sufferable latitudes the ship with mild stunsails spread floated across the tranquil tropics and to all appearances the old mans delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air even then when he bore that firm collected front however pale and issued his calm orders once again and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone even then Ahab in his hidden self raved on  Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing  When you think it fled it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form  Ahabs full lunacy subsided not but deepeningly contracted like the unabated Hudson when that noble Northman flows narrowly but unfathomably through the Highland gorge  But as in his narrowflowing monomania not one jot of Ahabs broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished  That before living agent now became the living instrument  If such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and carried it and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that far from having lost his strength Ahab to that one end did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object  This is much yet Ahabs larger darker deeper part remains unhinted  But vain to popularize profundities and all truth is profound  Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here standhowever grand and wonderful now quit itand take your way ye nobler sadder souls to those vast Roman halls of Thermes where far beneath the fantastic towers of mans upper earth his root of grandeur his whole awful essence sits in bearded state an antique buried beneath antiquities and throned on torsoes  So with a broken throne the great gods mock that captive king so like a Caryatid he patient sits upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages  Wind ye down there ye prouder sadder souls question that proud sad king  A family likeness aye he did beget ye ye young exiled royalties and from your grim sire only will the old Statesecret come  Now in his heart Ahab had some glimpse of this namely all my means are sane my motive and my object mad  Yet without power to kill or change or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble in some sort did still  But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility not to his will determinate  Nevertheless so well did he succeed in that dissembling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him  The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause  And so too all the added moodiness which always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage sat brooding on his brow  Nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptoms the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales Gnawed within and scorched without with the infixed unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes  Or if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack  But be all this as it may certain it is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and allengrossing object of hunting the White Whale  Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man  They were bent on profitable cruises the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint  He was intent on an audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge  Here then was this greyheaded ungodly old man chasing with curses a Jobs whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly made up of mongrel renegades and castaways and cannibalsmorally enfeebled also by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or rightmindedness in Starbuck the invunerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb and the pervading mediocrity in Flask  Such a crew so officered seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge  How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old mans ireby what evil magic their souls were possessed that at times his hate seemed almost theirs the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his how all this came to bewhat the White Whale was to them or how to their unconscious understandings also in some dim unsuspected way he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of lifeall this to explain would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go  The subterranean miner that works in us all how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting muffled sound of his pick  Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag  What skiff in tow of a seventyfour can stand still  For one I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all arush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill CHAPTER 42  The Whiteness of The WhaleWhat the white whale was to Ahab has been hinted what at times he was to me as yet remains unsaid  Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick which could not but occasionally awaken in any mans soul some alarm there was another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning him which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me But how can I hope to explain myself here and yet in some dim random way explain myself I must else all these chapters might be naught  Though in many natural objects whiteness refiningly enhances beauty as if imparting some special virtue of its own as in marbles japonicas and pearls and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old kings of Pegu placing the title Lord of the White Elephants above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snowwhite quadruped in the royal standard and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snowwhite charger and the great Austrian Empire Caesarian heir to overlording Rome having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue and though this preeminence in it applies to the human race itself giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all this whiteness has been even made significant of gladness for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings this same hue is made the emblem of many touching noble thingsthe innocence of brides the benignity of age though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour though in many climes whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milkwhite steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power by the Persian fire worshippers the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar and in the Greek mythologies Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snowwhite bull and though to the noble Iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology that spotless faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity and though directly from the Latin word for white all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture the alb or tunic worn beneath the cassock and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord though in the Vision of St John white robes are given to the redeemed and the fourandtwenty elders stand clothed in white before the greatwhite throne and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool yet for all these accumulated associations with whatever is sweet and honourable and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood  This elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness when divorced from more kindly associations and coupled with any object terrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds  Witness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of the tropics what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are  That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect  So that not the fiercefanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the whiteshrouded bear or sharkWith reference to the Polar bear it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not the whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened hideousness it might be said only rises from the circumstance that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast  But even assuming all this to be true yet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified terror  As for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped  This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish  The Romish mass for the dead begins with Requiem eternam eternal rest whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itself and any other funeral music  Now in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and the mild deadliness of his habits the French call him REQUINBethink thee of the albatross whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations  Not Coleridge first threw that spell but Gods great unflattering laureate NatureI remember the first albatross I ever saw  It was during a prolonged gale in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas  From my forenoon watch below I ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the main hatches I saw a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and with a hooked Roman bill sublime  At intervals it arched forth its vast archangel wings as if to embrace some holy ark  Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it  Though bodily unharmed it uttered cries as some kings ghost in supernatural distress  Through its inexpressible strange eyes methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God  As Abraham before the angels I bowed myself the white thing was so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiled waters I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns  Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage  I cannot tell can only hint the things that darted through me then  But at last I awoke and turning asked a sailor what bird was this  A goney he replied  Goney never had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore never  But some time after I learned that goney was some seamans name for albatross  So that by no possibility could Coleridges wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine when I saw that bird upon our deck  For neither had I then read the Rhyme nor knew the bird to be an albatross  Yet in saying this I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet  I assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses and these I have frequently seen but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl  But how had the mystic thing been caught  Whisper it not and I will tell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl floated on the sea  At last the Captain made a postman of it tying a lettered leathern tally round its neck with the ships time and place and then letting it escape  But I doubt not that leathern tally meant for man was taken off in Heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wingfolding the invoking and adoring cherubimMost famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies a magnificent milkwhite charger largeeyed smallheaded bluffchested and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty overscorning carriage  He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies  At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light  The flashing cascade of his mane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silverbeaters could have furnished him  A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god bluffbrowed and fearless as this mighty steed  Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains like an Ohio or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presented himself always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe  Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror  But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross  What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin  It is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the name he bears  The Albino is as well made as other menhas no substantive deformityand yet this mere aspect of allpervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion Why should this be so  Nor in quite other aspects does Nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible  From its snowy aspect the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall  Nor in some historic instances has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary  How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in Froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their faction the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the marketplace  Nor in some things does the common hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue  It cannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering there as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here  And from that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them  Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts rising in a milkwhite fogYea while these terrors seize us let us add that even the king of terrors when personified by the evangelist rides on his pallid horse  Therefore in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul  But though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man to account for it  To analyse it would seem impossible  Can we then by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whitenessthough for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful but nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery however modifiedcan we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek  Let us try  But in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtlety and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls And though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be able to recall them now  Why to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless processions of slowpacing pilgrims downcast and hooded with newfallen snow  Or to the unread unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul  Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American than those other storied structures its neighborsthe Byward Tower or even the Bloody  And those sublimer towers the White Mountains of New Hampshire whence in peculiar moods comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name while the thought of Virginias Blue Ridge is full of a soft dewy distant dreaminess  Or why irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets Or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe does the tall pale man of the Hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groveswhy is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg  Nor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedraltoppling earthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires wrenched copestones and crosses all adroop like canted yards of anchored fleets and her suburban avenues of housewalls lying over upon each other as a tossed pack of cardsit is not these things alone which make tearless Lima the strangest saddest city thou canst see  For Lima has taken the white veil and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe  Old as Pizarro this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions  I know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality  What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples  First The mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands if by night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but under precisely similar circumstances let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whitenessas if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him then he feels a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings heart and helm they both go down he never rests till blue water is under him again  Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee Sir it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me  Second To the native Indian of Peru the continual sight of the snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes  Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness  Not so the sailor beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas where at times by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air he shivering and half shipwrecked instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses  But thou sayest methinks that whitelead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a hypo Ishmael  Tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont far removed from all beasts of preywhy is it that upon the sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that he cannot even see it but only smells its wild animal muskinesswhy will he start snort and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright  There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils for what knows he this New England colt of the black bisons of distant Oregon  No but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world  Though thousands of miles from Oregon still when he smells that savage musk the rending goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies which this instant they may be trampling into dust  Thus then the muffled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies all these to Ishmael are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt  Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints yet with me as with the colt somewhere those things must exist  Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love the invisible spheres were formed in fright  But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul and more strange and far more portentouswhy as we have seen it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things nay the very veil of the Christians Deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind  Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the milky way  Or is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all colours is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscape of snowsa colourless allcolour of atheism from which we shrink  And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers that all other earthly huesevery stately or lovely emblazoningthe sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea and the gilded velvets of butterflies and the butterfly cheeks of young girls all these are but subtile deceits not actually inherent in substances but only laid on from without so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot whose allurements cover nothing but the charnelhouse within and when we proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues the great principle of light for ever remains white or colourless in itself and if operating without medium upon matter would touch all objects even tulips and roses with its own blank tingepondering all this the palsied universe lies before us a leper and like wilful travellers in Lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him  And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt CHAPTER 43  HarkHIST  Did you hear that noise Cabaco  It was the middlewatch a fair moonlight the seamen were standing in a cordon extending from one of the freshwater butts in the waist to the scuttlebutt near the taffrail  In this manner they passed the buckets to fill the scuttlebutt  Standing for the most part on the hallowed precincts of the quarterdeck they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet  From hand to hand the buckets went in the deepest silence only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel  It was in the midst of this repose that Archy one of the cordon whose post was near the afterhatches whispered to his neighbor a Cholo the words above  Hist did you hear that noise Cabaco  Take the bucket will ye Archy what noise dye mean  There it is againunder

CHAPTER 44  The ChartHad you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts spread them before him on his screweddown table  Then seating himself before it you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank  At intervals he would refer to piles of old logbooks beside him wherein were set down the seasons and places in which on various former voyages of various ships sperm whales had been captured or seen  While thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead  But it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of his cabin Ahab thus pondered over his charts  Almost every night they were brought out almost every night some pencil marks were effaced and others were substituted  For with the charts of all four oceans before him Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul  Now to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet  But not so did it seem to Ahab who knew the sets of all tides and currents and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whales food and also calling to mind the regular ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes could arrive at reasonable surmises almost approaching to certainties concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey  So assured indeed is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whales resorting to given waters that many hunters believe that could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herringshoals or the flights of swallows  On this hint attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whaleSince the above was written the statement is happily borne out by an official circular issued by Lieutenant Maury of the National Observatory Washington April 16th 1851  By that circular it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion and portions of it are presented in the circular  This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district and the two others to show the number of days in which whales sperm or right have been seenBesides when making a passage from one feedingground to another the sperm whales guided by some infallible instinctsay rather secret intelligence from the Deitymostly swim in VEINS as they are called continuing their way along a given oceanline with such undeviating exactitude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with one tithe of such marvellous precision  Though in these cases the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyors parallel and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim generally embraces some few miles in width more or less as the vein is presumed to expand or contract but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whaleships mastheads when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone  The sum is that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for  And hence not only at substantiated times upon well known separate feedinggrounds could Ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could by his art so place and time himself on his way as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting  There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme  But not so in the reality perhaps  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year say will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true  In general the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen for example on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast yet it did not follow that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there  So too with some other feeding grounds where he had at times revealed himself  But all these seemed only his casual stoppingplaces and oceaninns so to speak not his places of prolonged abode  And where Ahabs chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of allusion has only been made to whatever wayside antecedent extra prospects were his ere a particular set time or place were attained when all possibilities would become probabilities and as Ahab fondly thought every possibility the next thing to a certainty  That particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrasethe SeasonontheLine  For there and then for several consecutive years Moby Dick had been periodically descried lingering in those waters for awhile as the sun in its annual round loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac  There it was too that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place there the waves were storied with his deeds there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance  But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned however flattering it might be to those hopes nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest  Now the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the SeasonontheLine  No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards double Cape Horn and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there  Therefore he must wait for the next ensuing season  Yet the premature hour of the Pequods sailing had perhaps been correctly selected by Ahab with a view to this very complexion of things  Because an interval of three hundred and sixtyfive days and nights was before him an interval which instead of impatiently enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance the White Whale spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feedinggrounds should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf or in the Bengal Bay or China Seas or in any other waters haunted by his race  So that Monsoons Pampas NorWesters Harmattans Trades any wind but the Levanter and Simoon might blow Moby Dick into the devious zigzag worldcircle of the Pequods circumnavigating wake  But granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even as a whitebearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople  Yes  For the peculiar snowwhite brow of Moby Dick and his snowwhite hump could not but be unmistakable  And have I not tallied the whale Ahab would mutter to himself as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveriestallied him and shall he escape  His broad fins are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheeps ear  And here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength  Ah God what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire  He sleeps with clenched hands and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms  Often when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughts through the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing of his lifespot became insufferable anguish and when as was sometimes the case these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base and a chasm seemed opening in him from which forked flames and lightnings shot up and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wild cry would be heard through the ship and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room as though escaping from a bed that was on fire  Yet these perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were but the plainest tokens of its intensity For at such times crazy Ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this Ahab that had gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again  The latter was the eternal living principle or soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time it was no longer an integral  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul therefore it must have been that in Ahabs case yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose that purpose by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of selfassumed independent being of its own  Nay could grimly live and burn while the common vitality to which it was conjoined fled horrorstricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth  Therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without an object to colour and therefore a blankness in itself  God help thee old man thy thoughts have created a creature in thee and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever that vulture the very creature he creates CHAPTER 45  The AffidavitSo far as what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeed as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter in its earlier part is as important a one as will be found in this volume but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon in order to be adequately understood and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair  I care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and from these citations I take itthe conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself  First I have personally known three instances where a whale after receiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after an interval in one instance of three years has been again struck by the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same private cypher have been taken from the body  In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons and I think it may have been something more than that the man who darted them happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated far into the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two years often endangered by serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions  Meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa but to no purpose  This man and this whale again came together and the one vanquished the other  I say I myself have known three instances similar to this that is in two of them I saw the whales struck and upon the second attack saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish  In the threeyear instance it so fell out that I was in the boat both times first and last and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whales eye which I had observed there three years previous  I say three years but I am pretty sure it was more than that  Here are three instances then which I personally know the truth of but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach  Secondly It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery however ignorant the world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable  Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil  No the reason was this that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance  Like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if they pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for their presumption  But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrityNay you may call it an oceanwide renown not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death but he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinctions of a name had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar  Was it not so O Timor Tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long didst lurk in the Oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay  Was it not so O New Zealand Jack thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land  Was it not so O Morquan King of Japan whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snowwhite cross against the sky  Was it not so O Don Miguel thou Chilian whale marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back  In plain prose here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar  But this is not all  New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels were finally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and killed by valiant whaling captains who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip  I do not know where I can find a better place than just here to make mention of one or two other things which to me seem important as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White Whale more especially the catastrophe  For this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error  So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that without some hints touching the plain facts historical and otherwise of the fishery they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable or still worse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory  First Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vivid conception of those perils and the frequency with which they recur  One reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery ever finds a public record at home however transient and immediately forgotten that record  Do you suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the whaleline off the coast of New Guinea is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathando you suppose that that poor fellows name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read tomorrow at your breakfast No because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea In fact did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea  Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific among many others we spoke thirty different ships every one of which had had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each lost a boats crew For Gods sake be economical with your lamps and candles not a gallon you burn but at least one drop of mans blood was spilled for it  Secondly People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this twofold enormousness they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness when I declare upon my soul I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt  But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own  That point is this The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the Sperm Whale HAS done it  First In the year 1820 the ship Essex Captain Pollard of Nantucket was cruising in the Pacific Ocean  One day she saw spouts lowered her boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales Ere long several of the whales were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping from the boats issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon the ship  Dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove her in that in less than ten minutes she settled down and fell over  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since After the severest exposure part of the crew reached the land in their boats  Being returned home at last Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers for the second time his ship was utterly lost and forthwith forswearing the sea he has never tempted it since  At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket  I have seen Owen Chace who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy I have read his plain and faithful narrative I have conversed with his son and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastropheThe following are extracts from Chaces narrative Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations he made two several attacks upon the ship at a short interval between them both of which according to their direction were calculated to do us the most injury by being made ahead and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock to effect which the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary  His aspect was most horrible and such as indicated resentment and fury  He came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered and in which we had struck three of his companions as if fired with revenge for their sufferings  Again At all events the whole circumstances taken together all happening before my own eyes and producing at the time impressions in my mind of decided calculating mischief on the part of the whale many of which impressions I cannot now recall induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion  Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship during a black night an open boat when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore  The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed upon hidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moments thought the dismal looking wreck and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE wholly engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance  In another placep 45he speaks of THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL ATTACK OF THE ANIMALSecondly The ship Union also of Nantucket was in the year 1807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it  Thirdly Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J then commanding an American sloopofwar of the first class happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu Sandwich Islands  Conversation turning upon whales the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present  He peremptorily denied for example that any whale could so smite his stout sloopofwar as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful  Very good but there is more coming  Some weeks after the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso  But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale that begged a few moments confidential business with him  That business consisted in fetching the Commodores craft such a thwack that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair I am not superstitious but I consider the Commodores interview with that whale as providential  Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright  I tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense  I will now refer you to Langsdorffs Voyages for a little circumstance in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof Langsdorff you must know by the way was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusensterns famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century  Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter  By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail and the next day we were out in the open sea on our way to Ochotsh  The weather was very clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing  For some days we had very little wind it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up  An uncommon large whale the body of which was larger than the ship itself lay almost at the surface of the water but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship which was in full sail was almost upon him so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him  We were thus placed in the most imminent danger as this gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship three feet at least out of the water  The masts reeled and the sails fell altogether while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity  Captain DWolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured  Now the Captain DWolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question is a New Englander who after a long life of unusual adventures as a seacaptain this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston  I have the honour of being a nephew of his I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff  He substantiates every word  The ship however was by no means a large one a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home  In that up and down manly book of oldfashioned adventure so full too of honest wondersthe voyage of Lionel Wafer one of ancient Dampiers old chumsI found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example if such be needed  Lionel it seems was on his way to John Ferdinando as he calls the modern Juan Fernandes  In our way thither he says about four oclock in the morning when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of America our ship felt a terrible shock which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think but every one began to prepare for death  And indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement was a little over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks  Captain Davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrown out of his cabin  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake somewhere about that time did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land  But I should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath  I might proceed with several more examples one way or another known to me of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale  In more than one instance he has been known not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships but to pursue the ship itself and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks  The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head and as for his strength let me say that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and secured there the whale towing her great hull through the water as a horse walks off with a cart Again it is very often observed that if the sperm whale once struck is allowed time to rally he then acts not so often with blind rage as with wilful deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes  But I must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration a remarkable and most significant one by which you will not fail to see that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day but that these marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages so that for the millionth time we say amen with SolomonVerily there is nothing new under the sun  In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius a Christian magistrate of Constantinople in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general  As many know he wrote the history of his own times a work every way of uncommon value  By the best authorities he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in some one or two particulars not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned  Now in this history of his Procopius mentions that during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople a great seamonster was captured in the neighboring Propontis or Sea of Marmora after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid  Nor is there any reason it should be  Of what precise species this seamonster was is not mentioned  But as he destroyed ships as well as for other reasons he must have been a whale and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale  And I will tell you why  For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it  Even now I am certain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in the present constitution of things a place for his habitual gregarious resort  But further investigations have recently proved to me that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean  I am told on good authority that on the Barbary coast a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale  Now as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis  In the Propontis as far as I can learn none of that peculiar substance called BRIT is to be found the aliment of the right whale But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whalesquid or cuttlefishlurks at the bottom of that sea because large creatures but by no means the largest of that sort have been found at its surface  If then you properly put these statements together and reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all human reasoning Procopiuss seamonster that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor must in all probability have been a sperm whale CHAPTER 46  SurmisesThough consumed with the hot fire of his purpose Ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whalemans ways altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage  Or at least if this were otherwise there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him  It would be refining too much perhaps even considering his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted  But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable there were still additional considerations which though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion yet were by no means incapable of swaying him  To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order  He knew for example that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation  Starbucks body and Starbucks coerced will were Ahabs so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbucks brain still he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his captains quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate it It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen  During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captains leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him  Not only that but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that for the present the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background for few mens courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action that when they stood their long night watches his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick  For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliablethey live in the varying outer weather and they inhale its ficklenessand when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the end it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash  Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing  In times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations but such times are evanescent  The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought Ahab is sordidness  Granting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knighterrantism in them still while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick they must also have food for their more common daily appetites  For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre without committing burglaries picking pockets and gaining other pious perquisites by the way  Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic objectthat final and romantic object too many would have turned from in disgust  I will not strip these men thought Ahab of all hopes of cashaye cash  They may scorn cash now but let some months go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier Ahab  Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab personally  Having impulsively it is probable and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequods voyage Ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further obedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself  That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand backed by a heedful closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to  For all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the Pequods voyage observe all customary usages and not only that but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession  Be all this as it may his voice was now often heard hailing the three mastheads and admonishing them to keep a bright lookout and not omit reporting even a porpoise  This vigilance was not long without reward CHAPTER 47  The MatMakerIt was a cloudy sultry afternoon the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks or vacantly gazing over into the leadcoloured waters  Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a swordmat for an additional lashing to our boat  So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self  I was the attendant or page of Queequeg while busy at the mat  As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and as Queequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads and idly looking off upon the water carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates  There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single ever returning unchanging vibration and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own  This warp seemed necessity and here thought I with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads Meantime Queequegs impulsive indifferent sword sometimes hitting the woof slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly as the case might be and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric this savages sword thought I which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof this easy indifferent sword must be chanceaye chance free will and necessitynowise incompatibleall interweavingly working together  The straight warp of necessity not to be swerved from its ultimate courseits every alternating vibration indeed only tending to that free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads and chance though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity and sideways in its motions directed by free will though thus prescribed to by both chance by turns rules either and has the last featuring blow at eventsThus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange long drawn and musically wild and unearthly that the ball of free will dropped from my hand and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing  High aloft in the crosstrees was that mad GayHeader Tashtego  His body was reaching eagerly forward his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries  To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas from hundreds of whalemens lookouts perched as high in the air but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indians  As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate and by those wild cries announcing their coming  There she blows there there there she blows she blows  Whereaway  On the leebeam about two miles off a school of them  Instantly all was commotion  The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity  And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus  There go flukes was now the cry from Tashtego and the whales disappeared  Quick steward cried Ahab  Time time  DoughBoy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exact minute to Ahab  The ship was now kept away from the wind and she went gently rolling before it  Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows  For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when sounding with his head in one direction he nevertheless while concealed beneath the surface mills round and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarterthis deceitfulness of his could not now be in action for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity  One of the men selected for shipkeepersthat is those not appointed to the boats by this time relieved the Indian at the mainmast head  The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down the line tubs were fixed in their places the cranes were thrust out the mainyard was backed and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs  Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale  So look the long line of manofwars men about to throw themselves on board an enemys ship  But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale  With a start all glared at dark Ahab who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air CHAPTER 48  The First LoweringThe phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side of the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there  This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats though technically called the captains on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steellike lips  A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff  But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head  Less swart in aspect the companions of this figure were of that vivid tigeryellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillasa race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil their lord whose countingroom they suppose to be elsewhere  While yet the wondering ships company were gazing upon these strangers Ahab cried out to the whiteturbaned old man at their head All ready there Fedallah  Ready was the halfhissed reply  Lower away then dye hear shouting across the deck  Lower away there I say  Such was the thunder of his voice that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks with a wallow the three boats dropped into the sea while with a dexterous offhanded daring unknown in any other vocation the sailors goatlike leaped down the rolling ships side into the tossed boats below  Hardly had they pulled out from under the ships lee when a fourth keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab who standing erect in the stern loudly hailed Starbuck Stubb and Flask to spread themselves widely so as to cover a large expanse of water  But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command  Captain Ahab said Starbuck  Spread yourselves cried Ahab give way all four boats  Thou Flask pull out more to leeward  Aye aye sir cheerily cried little KingPost sweeping round his great steering oar  Lay back addressing his crew Theretherethere again  There she blows right ahead boyslay back  Never heed yonder yellow boys Archy  Oh I dont mindem sir said Archy I knew it all before now Didnt I hear em in the hold  And didnt I tell Cabaco here of it What say ye Cabaco  They are stowaways Mr Flask  Pull pull my fine heartsalive pull my children pull my little ones drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness  Why dont you break your backbones my boys  What is it you stare at  Those chaps in yonder boat  Tut  They are only five more hands come to help usnever mind from wherethe more the merrier  Pull then do pull never mind the brimstonedevils are good fellows enough  So so there you are now thats the stroke for a thousand pounds thats the stroke to sweep the stakes  Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil my heroes  Three cheers menall hearts alive  Easy easy dont be in a hurrydont be in a hurry  Why dont you snap your oars you rascals  Bite something you dogs  So so so thensoftly softly  Thats itthats it long and strong  Give way there give way  The devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallions ye are all asleep  Stop snoring ye sleepers and pull  Pull will ye pull cant ye pull wont ye  Why in the name of gudgeons and gingercakes dont ye pullpull and break something pull and start your eyes out  Here whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle every mothers son of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth  Thats itthats it  Now ye do something that looks like it my steelbits  Start herstart her my silverspoons  Start her marlingspikes  Stubbs exordium to his crew is given here at large because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing  But you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation  Not at all and therein consisted his chief peculiarity  He would say the most terrific things to his crew in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing  Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed his steeringoar and so broadly gapedopenmouthed at timesthat the mere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrast acted like a charm upon the crew  Then again Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them  In obedience to a sign from Ahab Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across Stubbs bow and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other Stubb hailed the mate  Mr Starbuck larboard boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye please  Halloa returned Starbuck turning round not a single inch as he spoke still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew his face set like a flint from Stubbs  What think ye of those yellow boys sir  Smuggled on board somehow before the ship sailed Strong strong boys in a whisper to his crew then speaking out loud again A sad business Mr Stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but never mind Mr Stubb all for the best  Let all your crew pull strong come what will Spring my men spring Theres hogsheads of sperm ahead Mr Stubb and thats what ye came for Pull my boys Sperm sperms the play  This at least is duty duty and profit hand in hand  Aye aye I thought as much soliloquized Stubb when the boats diverged as soon as I clapt eye on em I thought so  Aye and thats what he went into the after hold for so often as DoughBoy long suspected  They were hidden down there  The White Whales at the bottom of it  Well well so be it  Cant be helped  All right  Give way men  It aint the White Whale today  Give way  Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ships company but Archys fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in some small measure prepared them for the event  It took off the extreme edge of their wonder and so what with all this and Stubbs confident way of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahabs precise agency in the matter from the beginning  For me I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah  Meantime Ahab out of hearing of his officers having sided the furthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him  Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five triphammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer  As for Fedallah who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon while at the other end of the boat Ahab with one arm like a fencers thrown half backward into the air as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him  All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed while the boats five oars were seen simultaneously peaked  Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea  Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way  The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it  Every man look out along his oars cried Starbuck  Thou Queequeg stand up  Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the savage stood erect there and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried  Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea  Not very far distant Flasks boat was also lying breathlessly still its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform  It is used for catching turns with the whale line  Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a mans hand and standing upon such a base as that Flask seemed perched at the masthead of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks  But little KingPost was small and short and at the same time little KingPost was full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead standpoint of his did by no means satisfy KingPost  I cant see three seas off tip us up an oar there and let me on to that  Upon this Daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal  Good a masthead as any sir  Will you mount  That I will and thank ye very much my fine fellow only I wish you fifty feet taller  Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palm to Flasks foot and then putting Flasks hand on his hearseplumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders And here was Flask now standing Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by  At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and crossrunning seas  Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances  But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious for sustaining himself with a cool indifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form  On his broad back flaxenhaired Flask seemed a snowflake  The bearer looked nobler than the rider  Though truly vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negros lordly chest  So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that  Meanwhile Stubb the third mate betrayed no such fargazing solicitudes  The whales might have made one of their regular soundings not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case Stubb as his wont in such cases it seems was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe  He withdrew it from his hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather  He loaded it and rammed home the loading with his thumbend but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand when Tashtego his harpooneer whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry Down down all and give waythere they are  To a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white rolling billows  The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as it were like the air over intensely heated plates of iron  Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of water also the whales were swimming  Seen in advance of all the other indications the puffs of vapour they spouted seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders  All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air  But it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and on as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills  Pull pull my good boys said Starbuck in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses  He did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew say anything to him  Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers now harsh with command now soft with entreaty  How different the loud little KingPost  Sing out and say something my hearties  Roar and pull my thunderbolts  Beach me beach me on their black backs boys only do that for me and Ill sign over to you my Marthas Vineyard plantation boys including wife and children boys  Lay me onlay me on  O Lord Lord but I shall go stark staring mad  See see that white water  And so shouting he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far off upon the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boats stern like a crazed colt from the prairie  Look at that chap now philosophically drawled Stubb who with his unlighted short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a short distance followed afterHes got fits that Flask has Fits yes give him fitsthats the very wordpitch fits into em Merrily merrily heartsalive  Pudding for supper you knowmerrys the word  Pull babespull sucklingspull all But what the devil are you hurrying about  Softly softly and steadily my men  Only pull and keep pulling nothing more  Crack all your backbones and bite your knives in twothats all  Take it easywhy dont ye take it easy I say and burst all your livers and lungs  But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tigeryellow crew of histhese were words best omitted here for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land  Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words when with tornado brow and eyes of red murder and foamglued lips Ahab leaped after his prey  Meanwhile all the boats tore on  The repeated specific allusions of Flask to that whale as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boats bow with its tailthese allusions of his were at times so vivid and lifelike that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder  But this was against all rule for the oarsmen must put out their eyes and ram a skewer through their necks usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears and no limbs but arms in these critical moments  It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe  The vast swells of the omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made as they rolled along the eight gunwales like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowlinggreen the brief suspended agony of the boat as it would tip for an instant on the knifelike edge of the sharper waves that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill the headlong sledlike slide down its other sideall these with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails like a wild hen after her screaming broodall this was thrilling  Not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle not the dead mans ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other worldneither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of the hunted sperm whale  The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloudshadows flung upon the sea  The jets of vapour no longer blended but tilted everywhere to right and left the whales seemed separating their wakes  The boats were pulled more apart Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward  Our sail was now set and with the still rising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through the water that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the rowlocks  Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist neither ship nor boat to be seen  Give way men whispered Starbuck drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes  Theres white water againclose to  Spring  Soon after two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast but hardly were they overheard when with a lightninglike hurtling whisper Starbuck said Stand up and Queequeg harpoon in hand sprang to his feet  Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the imminent instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter  Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents  Thats his hump  THERE THERE give it to him whispered Starbuck  A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it was the darted iron of Queequeg  Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge the sail collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapour shot up near by something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us  The whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helterskelter into the white curdling cream of the squall  Squall whale and harpoon had all blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped  Though completely swamped the boat was nearly unharmed  Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars and lashing them across the gunwale tumbled back to our places  There we sat up to our knees in the sea the water covering every rib and plank so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean  The wind increased to a howl the waves dashed their bucklers together the whole squall roared forked and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal in these jaws of death  In vain we hailed the other boats as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm  Meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew darker with the shadows of night no sign of the ship could be seen  The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat  The oars were useless as propellers performing now the office of lifepreservers  So cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching it on a waif pole handed it to Queequeg as the standardbearer of this forlorn hope  There then he sat holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness  There then he sat the sign and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair  Wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship or boat we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on  The mist still spread over the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat  Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet hollowing his hand to his ear  We all heard a faint creaking as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm  The sound came nearer and nearer the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge vague form  Affrighted we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length  Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ships bows like a chip at the base of a cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern  Again we swam for it were dashed against it by the seas and were at last taken up and safely landed on board  Ere the squall came close to the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time  The ship had given us up but was still cruising if haply it might light upon some token of our perishingan oar or a lance pole CHAPTER 49  The HyenaThere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than suspects that the joke is at nobodys expense but his own However nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth while disputing He bolts down all events all creeds and beliefs and persuasions all hard things visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints  And as for small difficulties and worryings prospects of sudden disaster peril of life and limb all these and death itself seem to him only sly goodnatured hits and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker  That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation it comes in the very midst of his earnestness so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous now seems but a part of the general joke  There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod and the great White Whale its object  Queequeg said I when they had dragged me the last man to the deck and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water Queequeg my fine friend does this sort of thing often happen  Without much emotion though soaked through just like me he gave me to understand that such things did often happen  Mr Stubb said I turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his oiljacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain Mr Stubb I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief mate Mr Starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent  I suppose then that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whalemans discretion  Certain  Ive lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape Horn  Mr Flask said I turning to little KingPost who was standing close by you are experienced in these things and I am not  Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery Mr Flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself backforemost into deaths jaws  Cant you twist that smaller said Flask  Yes thats the law  I should like to see a boats crew backing water up to a whale face foremost  Ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind that  Here then from three impartial witnesses I had a deliberate statement of the entire case  Considering therefore that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boatoftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbucks driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall and considering that Starbuck notwithstanding was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbucks boat and finally considering in what a devils chase I was implicated touching the White Whale taking all things together I say I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will  Queequeg said I come along you shall be my lawyer executor and legatee  It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion  This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the same thing  After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion I felt all the easier a stone was rolled away from my heart  Besides all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be  I survived myself my death and burial were locked up in my chest  I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault  Now then thought I unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock here goes for a cool collected dive at death and destruction and the devil fetch the hindmost CHAPTER 50  Ahabs Boat and Crew  FedallahWho would have thought it Flask cried Stubb if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat unless maybe to stop the plughole with my timber toe  Oh hes a wonderful old man  I dont think it so strange after all on that account said Flask  If his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thing  That would disable him but he has one knee and good part of the other left you know  I dont know that my little man I never yet saw him kneelAmong whalewise people it has often been argued whether considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase  So Tamerlanes soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight  But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect  Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties that every individual moment indeed then comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whaleboat in the hunt  As a general thing the jointowners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not  Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the huntabove all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men as that same boats crew he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod  Therefore he had not solicited a boats crew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head  Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter  Until Cabacos published discovery the sailors had little foreseen it though to be sure when after being a little while out of port all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service when some time after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making tholepins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this was observed in him and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat as it is sometimes called the horizontal piece in the boats bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semicircular depression in the cleat and with the carpenters chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there all these things I say had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time  But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person  But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boats crew being assigned to that boat  Now with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon waned away for in a whaler wonders soon wane  Besides now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ashholes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks bits of wreck oars whaleboats canoes blownoff Japanese junks and what not that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle  But be all this as it may certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were somehow distinct from them yet that hairturbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last  Whence he came in a mannerly world like this by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahabs peculiar fortunes nay so far as to have some sort of a halfhinted influence Heaven knows but it might have been even authority over him all this none knew  But one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah  He was such a creature as civilized domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams and that but dimly but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continentthose insulated immemorial unalterable countries which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earths primal generations when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection and all men his descendants unknowing whence he came eyed each other as real phantoms and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end when though according to Genesis the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men the devils also add the uncanonical Rabbins indulged in mundane amours CHAPTER 51  The SpiritSpoutDays weeks passed and under easy sail the ivory Pequod had slowly swept across four several cruisinggrounds that off the Azores off the Cape de Verdes on the Plate so called being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata and the Carrol Ground an unstaked watery locality southerly from St Helena  It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver and by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silvery silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow  Lit up by the moon it looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea  Fedallah first descried this jet  For of these moonlight nights it was his wont to mount to the mainmast head and stand a lookout there with the same precision as if it had been day  And yet though herds of whales were seen by night not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them  You may think with what emotions then the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours his turban and the moon companions in one sky  But when after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound when after all this silence his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moonlit jet every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew  There she blows  Had the trump of judgment blown they could not have quivered more yet still they felt no terror rather pleasure  For though it was a most unwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and so deliriously exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering  Walking the deck with quick sidelunging strides Ahab commanded the tgallant sails and royals to be set and every stunsail spread  The best man in the ship must take the helm  Then with every masthead manned the piledup craft rolled down before the wind  The strange upheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet while still she rushed along as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in herone to mount direct to heaven the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal  And had you watched Ahabs face that night you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring  While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffintap  On life and death this old man walked But though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager glances shot yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night  Every sailor swore he saw it once but not a second time  This midnightspout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some days after lo at the same silent hour it was again announced again it was descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more it disappeared as if it had never been  And so it served us night after night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be disappearing again for one whole day or two days or three and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on  Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance with the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many things invested the Pequod were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried at however remote times or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes that unnearable spout was cast by one selfsame whale and that whale Moby Dick  For a time there reigned too a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on in order that the monster might turn round upon us and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas  These temporary apprehensions so vague but so awful derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in which beneath all its blue blandness some thought there lurked a devilish charm as for days and days we voyaged along through seas so wearily lonesomely mild that all space in repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed vacating itself of life before our urnlike prow  But at last when turning to the eastward the Cape winds began howling around us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seas that are there when the ivorytusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark waves in her madness till like showers of silver chips the foamflakes flew over her bulwarks then all this desolate vacuity of life went away but gave place to sights more dismal than before  Close to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable searavens  And every morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen and spite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp as though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing appointed to desolation and therefore fit roostingplace for their homeless selves  And heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the black sea as if its vast tides were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred  Cape of Good Hope do they call ye  Rather Cape Tormentoto as called of yore for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat that black air without any horizon  But calm snowwhite and unvarying still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky still beckoning us on from before the solitary jet would at times be descried  During all this blackness of the elements Ahab though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than ever addressed his mates  In tempestuous times like these after everything above and aloft has been secured nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale  Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists  So with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together  Meantime the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better to guard against the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung as in a loosened belt  Few or no words were spoken and the silent ship as if manned by painted sailors in wax day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves  By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still in silence the men swung in the bowlines still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast  Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock Never could Starbuck forget the old mans aspect when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floorscrewed chair the rain and halfmelted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat  On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of  His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand  Though the body was erect the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the telltale that swung from a beam in the ceilingThe cabincompass is called the telltale because without going to the compass at the helm the Captain while below can inform himself of the course of the shipTerrible old man thought Starbuck with a shudder sleeping in this gale still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose CHAPTER 52  The AlbatrossSoutheastward from the Cape off the distant Crozetts a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen a sail loomed ahead the Goney Albatross by name  As she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the foremasthead I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheriesa whaler at sea and long absent from home  As if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus  All down her sides this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoarfrost  Only her lower sails were set  A wild sight it was to see her longbearded lookouts at those three mastheads  They seemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising  Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea and though when the ship slowly glided close under our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mastheads of one ship to those of the other yet those forlornlooking fishermen mildly eyeing us as they passed said not one word to our own lookouts while the quarterdeck hail was being heard from below  Ship ahoy  Have ye seen the White Whale  But as the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwarks was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from his hand into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove to make himself heard without it  Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between  While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whales name to another ship Ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade  But taking advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpet and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home he loudly hailedAhoy there  This is the Pequod bound round the world  Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean and this time three years if I am not at home tell them to address them to  At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed and instantly then in accordance with their singular ways shoals of small harmless fish that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side darted away with what seemed shuddering fins and ranged themselves fore and aft with the strangers flanks  Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings  Swim away from me do ye murmured Ahab gazing over into the water  There seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced  But turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old lion voiceUp helm  Keep her off round the world  Round the world  There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct  Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that we left behind secure were all the time before us  Were this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances and discover sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon then there were promise in the voyage  But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swims before all human hearts while chasing such over this round globe they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed CHAPTER 53  The GamThe ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms  But even had this not been the case he would not after all perhaps have boarded herjudging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasionsif so it had been that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put  For as it eventually turned out he cared not to consort even for five minutes with any stranger captain except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought  But all this might remain inadequately estimated were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whalingvessels when meeting each other in foreign seas and especially on a common cruisingground  If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life of them cannot well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for a moment to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for a while and resting in concert then how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earthoff lone Fannings Island or the far away Kings Mills how much more natural I say that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails but come into still closer more friendly and sociable contact  And especially would this seem to be a matter of course in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whose captains officers and not a few of the men are personally known to each other and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about  For the long absent ship the outwardbounder perhaps has letters on board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumbworn files  And in return for that courtesy the outwardbound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruisingground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmost importance to her  And in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each others track on the cruisingground itself even though they are equally long absent from home  For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third and now far remote vessel and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets  Besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat  For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils  Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference that is so long as both parties speak one language as is the case with Americans and English  Though to be sure from the small number of English whalers such meetings do not very often occur and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your Englishman is rather reserved and your Yankee he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself  Besides the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers regarding the long lean Nantucketer with his nondescript provincialisms as a sort of seapeasant  But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the Yankees in one day collectively kill more whales than all the English collectively in ten years  But this is a harmless little foible in the English whalehunters which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knows that he has a few foibles himself  So then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea the whalers have most reason to be sociableand they are so  Whereas some merchant ships crossing each others wake in the midAtlantic will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition mutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace of dandies in Broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon each others rig  As for MenofWar when they chance to meet at sea they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings such a ducking of ensigns that there does not seem to be much rightdown hearty goodwill and brotherly love about it at all  As touching Slaveships meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurry they run away from each other as soon as possible  And as for Pirates when they chance to cross each others crossbones the first hail isHow many skullsthe same way that whalers hailHow many barrels  And that question once answered pirates straightway steer apart for they are infernal villains on both sides and dont like to see overmuch of each others villanous likenesses  But look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable freeandeasy whaler  What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather  She has a GAM a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at it and repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubberboilers and such like pretty exclamations  Why it is that all Merchantseamen and also all Pirates and ManofWars men and Slaveship sailors cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whaleships this is a question it would be hard to answer  Because in the case of pirates say I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it  It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the gallows  And besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude  Hence I conclude that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on  But what is a GAM  You might wear out your indexfinger running up and down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word  Dr Johnson never attained to that erudition Noah Websters ark does not hold it  Nevertheless this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees  Certainly it needs a definition and should be incorporated into the Lexicon  With that view let me learnedly define it  GAM  NOUNA SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO OR MORE WHALESHIPS GENERALLY ON A CRUISINGGROUND WHEN AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS THEY EXCHANGE VISITS BY BOATS CREWS THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING FOR THE TIME ON BOARD OF ONE SHIP AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER  There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here  All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail so has the whale fishery  In a pirate manofwar or slave ship when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often steers himself with a pretty little milliners tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons  But the whaleboat has no seat astern no sofa of that sort whatever and no tiller at all High times indeed if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs  And as for a tiller the whaleboat never admits of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming a complete boats crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree  And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs  Nor is this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the afteroar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front  He is thus completely wedged before and behind and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth  Merely make a spread angle of two poles and you cannot stand them up  Then again it would never do in plain sight of the worlds riveted eyes it would never do I say for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant selfcommand he generally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets but perhaps being generally very large heavy hands he carries them there for ballast  Nevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones too where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall sayto seize hold of the nearest oarsmans hair and hold on there like grim death CHAPTER 54  The TownHos StoryAS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INNThe Cape of Good Hope and all the watery region round about there is much like some noted four corners of a great highway where you meet more travellers than in any other part  It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homewardbound whaleman the TownHo was encountered  She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians  In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick  To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the TownHos story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men  This latter circumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates  For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the TownHo himself  It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship one of whom it seems communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it in that way that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest Nevertheless so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in this matter that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequods mainmast  Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting recordThe ancient whalecry upon first sighting a whale from the masthead still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapinFor my humors sake I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends one saints eve smoking upon the thickgilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn  Of those fine cavaliers the young Dons Pedro and Sebastian were on the closer terms with me and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put and which are duly answered at the time  Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you gentlemen the TownHo Sperm Whaler of Nantucket was cruising in your Pacific here not very many days sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn  She was somewhere to the northward of the Line  One morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common  They supposed a swordfish had stabbed her gentlemen  But the captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes and therefore being very averse to quit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her cruisings the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals but no good luck came more days went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased  So much so that now taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands there to have his hull hove out and repaired  Though no small passage was before her yet if the commonest chance favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way because his pumps were of the best and being periodically relieved at them those sixandthirty men of his could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on her  In truth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes the TownHo had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney the mate a Vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo  LakemanBuffalo  Pray what is a Lakeman and where is Buffalo said Don Sebastian rising in his swinging mat of grass  On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie Don butI crave your courtesymay be you shall soon hear further of all that  Now gentlemen in squaresail brigs and threemasted ships wellnigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla this Lakeman in the landlocked heart of our America had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean  For in their interflowing aggregate those grand freshwater seas of oursErie and Ontario and Huron and Superior and Michiganpossess an oceanlike expansiveness with many of the oceans noblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes  They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles even as the Polynesian waters do in large part are shored by two great contrasting nations as the Atlantic is they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East dotted all round their banks here and there are frowned upon by batteries and by the goatlike craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories at intervals they yield their beaches to wild barbarians whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland as well as Winnebago villages they float alike the fullrigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the State the steamer and the beech canoe they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwrecks are for out of sight of land however inland they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew  Thus gentlemen though an inlander Steelkilt was wildocean born and wildocean nurtured as much of an audacious mariner as any  And for Radney though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach to nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn handled bowieknives  Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some goodhearted traits and this Lakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible firmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slaves right thus treated this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile  At all events he had proved so thus far but Radney was doomed and made mad and Steelkiltbut gentlemen you shall hear  It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven that the TownHos leak seemed again increasing but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day  You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic for example some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward gentlemen is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pumphandles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them  It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters some really landless latitude that her captain begins to feel a little anxious  Much this way had it been with the TownHo so when her leak was found gaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company especially by Radney the mate He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way expanded to the breeze  Now this Radney I suppose was as little of a coward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine gentlemen  Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her  So when they were working that evening at the pumps there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water clear as any mountain spring gentlementhat bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupperholes  Now as you well know it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ourswatery or otherwise that when a person placed in command over his fellowmen finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subalterns tower and make a little heap of dust of it  Be this conceit of mine as it may gentlemen at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroys snorting charger and a brain and a heart and a soul in him gentlemen which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne had he been born son to Charlemagnes father  But Radney the mate was ugly as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicious  He did not love Steelkilt and Steelkilt knew it  Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest the Lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went on with his gay banterings  Aye aye my merry lads its a lively leak this hold a cannikin one of ye and lets have a taste  By the Lord its worth bottling I tell ye what men old Rads investment must go for it he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home  The fact is boys that swordfish only began the job hes come back again with a gang of shipcarpenters sawfish and filefish and what not and the whole posse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvements I suppose  If old Rad were here now Id tell him to jump overboard and scatter em  Theyre playing the devil with his estate I can tell him  But hes a simple old soulRad and a beauty too  Boys they say the rest of his property is invested in lookingglasses  I wonder if hed give a poor devil like me the model of his nose  Damn your eyes whats that pump stopping for roared Radney pretending not to have heard the sailors talk  Thunder away at it  Aye aye sir said Steelkilt merry as a cricket  Lively boys lively now  And with that the pump clanged like fifty fireengines the men tossed their hats off to it and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of lifes utmost energies  Quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the Lakeman went forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face fiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow  Now what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state I know not but so it happened  Intolerably striding along the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also a shovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large  Now gentlemen sweeping a ships deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time  Such gentlemen is the inflexibility of seausages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces  But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys if boys there be aboard  Besides it was the stronger men in the TownHo that had been divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps and being the most athletic seaman of them all Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties such being the case with his comrades  I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men  But there was more than this the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt as though Radney had spat in his face  Any man who has gone sailor in a whaleship will understand this and all this and doubtless much more the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command  But as he sat still for a moment and as he steadfastly looked into the mates malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powdercasks heaped up in him and the slowmatch silently burning along towards them as he instinctively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful beinga repugnance most felt when felt at all by really valiant men even when aggrievedthis nameless phantom feeling gentlemen stole over Steelkilt  Therefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business and he would not do it  And then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done little or nothing all day  To this Radney replied with an oath in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman with an uplifted coopers club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by  Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face furiously commanding him to do his bidding  Steelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his intention not to obey  Seeing however that his forbearance had not the slightest effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but it was to no purpose  And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer  Mr Radney I will not obey you  Take that hammer away or look to yourself  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where the Lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance Steelkilt clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he Steelkilt would murder him  But gentlemen the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods  Immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale  Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads  They were both Canallers  Canallers cried Don Pedro  We have seen many whaleships in our harbours but never heard of your Canallers  Pardon who and what are they  Canallers Don are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal You must have heard of it  Nay Senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary land we know but little of your vigorous North  Aye  Well then Don refill my cup  Your chichas very fine and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are for such information may throw sidelight upon my story  For three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through the entire breadth of the state of New York through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages through long dismal uninhabited swamps and affluent cultivated fields unrivalled for fertility by billiardroom and barroom through the holyofholies of great forests on Roman arches over Indian rivers through sun and shade by happy hearts or broken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties and especially by rows of snowwhite chapels whose spires stand almost like milestones flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life Theres your true Ashantee gentlemen there howl your pagans where you ever find them next door to you under the longflung shadow and the snug patronising lee of churches  For by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice so sinners gentlemen most abound in holiest vicinities  Is that a friar passing said Don Pedro looking downwards into the crowded plazza with humorous concern  Well for our northern friend Dame Isabellas Inquisition wanes in Lima laughed Don Sebastian  Proceed Senor  A moment  Pardon cried another of the company  In the name of all us Limeese I but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison  Oh do not bow and look surprised you know the proverb all along this coastCorrupt as Lima  It but bears out your saying too churches more plentiful than billiardtables and for ever openand Corrupt as Lima  So too Venice I have been there the holy city of the blessed evangelist St MarkSt Dominic purge it  Your cup  Thanks here I refill now you pour out again  Freely depicted in his own vocation gentlemen the Canaller would make a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he  Like Mark Antony for days and days along his greenturfed flowery Nile he indolently floats openly toying with his redcheeked Cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck  But ashore all this effeminacy is dashed  The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports his slouched and gailyribboned hat betoken his grand features  A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities  Once a vagabond on his own canal I have received good turns from one of these Canallers I thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one  In sum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whalefishery contains so many of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind except Sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling captains  Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian cornfield and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas  I see  I see impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles  No need to travel  The worlds one Lima  I had thought now that at your temperate North the generations were cold and holy as the hillsBut the story  I left off gentlemen where the Lakeman shook the backstay Hardly had he done so when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck  But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets the two Canallers rushed into the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle  Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out of harms way the valiant captain danced up and down with a whalepike calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarterdeck  At intervals he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion and prying into the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the object of his resentment  But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass these seaParisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade  Come out of that ye pirates roared the captain now menacing them with a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward Come out of that ye cutthroats  Steelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistols could do but gave the captain to understand distinctly that his Steelkilts death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands  Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty  Will you promise not to touch us if we do demanded their ringleader  Turn to turn toI make no promiseto your duty  Do you want to sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this  Turn to and he once more raised a pistol  Sink the ship cried Steelkilt  Aye let her sink  Not a man of us turns to unless you swear not to raise a ropeyarn against us What say ye men turning to his comrades  A fierce cheer was their response  The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye on the Captain and jerking out such sentences as theseIts not our fault we didnt want it I told him to take his hammer away it was boys business he might have known me before this I told him not to prick the buffalo I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw aint those mincing knives down in the forecastle there men look to those handspikes my hearties Captain by God look to yourself say the word dont be a fool forget it all we are ready to turn to treat us decently and were your men but we wont be flogged  Turn to  I make no promises turn to I say  Look ye now cried the Lakeman flinging out his arm towards him there are a few of us here and I am one of them who have shipped for the cruise dye see now as you well know sir we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down so we dont want a row its not our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but we wont be flogged  Turn to roared the Captain  Steelkilt glanced round him a moment and then saidI tell you what it is now Captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabby rascal we wont lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us but till you say the word about not flogging us we dont do a hands turn  Down into the forecastle then down with ye Ill keep ye there till yere sick of it  Down ye go  Shall we cried the ringleader to his men  Most of them were against it but at length in obedience to Steelkilt they preceded him down into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bears into a cave  As the Lakemans bare head was just level with the planks the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway  Then opening the slide a little the Captain whispered something down the crack closed it and turned the key upon themten in numberleaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had remained neutral  All night a wideawake watch was kept by all the officers forward and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below  But the hours of darkness passed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship  At sunrise the Captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned the prisoners to work but with a yell they refused  Water was then lowered down to them and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it the Captain returned to the quarterdeck  Twice every day for three days this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready to turn to  The fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution had constrained them to surrender at discretion  Emboldened by this the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged  On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them  Only three were left  Better turn to now said the Captain with a heartless jeer  Shut us up again will ye cried Steelkilt  Oh certainly the Captain and the key clicked  It was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armed with their keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implements with a handle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship  For himself he would do this he said whether they joined him or not  That was the last night he should spend in that den  But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender  And what was more they each insisted upon being the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come  But to this their leader as fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularly as his two comrades would not yield the one to the other in the matter and both of them could not be first for the ladder would but admit one man at a time  And here gentlemen the foul play of these miscreants must come out  Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit  But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed their before secret treacheries together and when their leader fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him with cords and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight  Thinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle In a few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder  But all these were collared and dragged along the deck like dead cattle and side by side were seized up into the mizzen rigging like three quarters of meat and there they hung till morning  Damn ye cried the Captain pacing to and fro before them the vultures would not touch ye ye villains  At sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all roundthought upon the whole he would do sohe ought tojustice demanded it but for the present considering their timely surrender he would let them go with a reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular  But as for you ye carrion rogues turning to the three men in the riggingfor you I mean to mince ye up for the trypots and seizing a rope he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung their heads sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn  My wrist is sprained with ye he cried at last but there is still rope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldnt give up  Take that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for himself  For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in a sort of hiss What I say is thisand mind it wellif you flog me I murder you  Say ye so then see how ye frighten meand the Captain drew off with the rope to strike  Best not hissed the Lakeman  But I mustand the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke  Steelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the Captain who to the amazement of all hands started back paced the deck rapidly two or three times and then suddenly throwing down his rope said I wont do itlet him gocut him down dye hear  But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a pale man with a bandaged head arrested themRadney the chief mate Ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole scene  Such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe  You are a coward hissed the Lakeman  So I am but take that  The mate was in the very act of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm  He paused and then pausing no more made good his word spite of Steelkilts threat whatever that might have been  The three men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumps clanged as before  Just after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamor was heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors running up besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew  Entreaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own instance they were put down in the ships run for salvation  Still no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest  On the contrary it seemed that mainly at Steelkilts instigation they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness obey all orders to the last and when the ship reached port desert her in a body But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thingnamely not to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered  For spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the TownHo still maintained her mastheads and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale  But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till all was over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart  He was in Radney the chief mates watch and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging he insisted against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming the head of his watch at night  Upon this and one or two other circumstances Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge  During the night Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarterdeck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there a little above the ships side In this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed  There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between this was the sea  Steelkilt calculated his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two oclock in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed  At his leisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below  What are you making there said a shipmate  What do you think what does it look like  Like a lanyard for your bag but its an odd one seems to me  Yes rather oddish said the Lakeman holding it at arms length before him but I think it will answer  Shipmate I havent enough twinehave you any  But there was none in the forecastle  Then I must get some from old Rad and he rose to go aft  You dont mean to go a begging to HIM said a sailor  Why not  Do you think he wont do me a turn when its to help himself in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked at him quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock  It was given himneither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakemans monkey jacket as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow  Twentyfour hours after his trick at the silent helmnigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seamans handthat fatal hour was then to come and in the foreordaining soul of Steelkilt the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed in  But gentlemen a fool saved the wouldbe murderer from the bloody deed he had planned  Yet complete revenge he had and without being the avenger  For by a mysterious fatality Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done  It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day when they were washing down the decks that a stupid Teneriffe man drawing water in the mainchains all at once shouted out There she rolls there she rolls  Jesu what a whale  It was Moby Dick  Moby Dick cried Don Sebastian St Dominic  Sir sailor but do whales have christenings  Whom call you Moby Dick  A very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster Donbut that would be too long a story  How how cried all the young Spaniards crowding  Nay Dons Donsnay nay  I cannot rehearse that now  Let me get more into the air Sirs  The chicha the chicha cried Don Pedro our vigorous friend looks faintfill up his empty glass  No need gentlemen one moment and I proceedNow gentlemen so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the shipforgetful of the compact among the crewin the excitement of the moment the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mastheads  All was now a phrensy  The White Whalethe White Whale was the cry from captain mates and harpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumours were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed askance and with curses the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea Gentlemen a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next him while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken the line at the word of command Moreover when the four boats were lowered the mates got the start and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt as he strained at his oar  After a stiff pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand Radney sprang to the bow  He was always a furious man it seems in a boat  And now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the whales topmost back  Nothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the standing mate  That instant as he fell on the whales slippery back the boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while Radney was tossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale  He struck out through the spray and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick  But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again and went down  Meantime at the first tap of the boats bottom the Lakeman had slackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly looking on he thought his own thoughts  But a sudden terrific downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line He cut it and the whale was free  But at some distance Moby Dick rose again with some tatters of Radneys red woollen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed him  All four boats gave chase again but the whale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared  In good time the TownHo reached her porta savage solitary placewhere no civilized creature resided  There headed by the Lakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large double warcanoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor  The ships company being reduced to but a handful the captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak  But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both by night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel  After taking counsel with his officers he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows stacked his muskets on the poop and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man with him and setting the sail of his best whaleboat steered straight before the wind for Tahiti five hundred miles distant to procure a reinforcement to his crew  On the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals  He steered away from it but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water The captain presented a pistol  With one foot on each prow of the yoked warcanoes the Lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubbles and foam  What do you want of me cried the captain  Where are you bound and for what are you bound demanded Steelkilt no lies  I am bound to Tahiti for more men  Very good  Let me board you a momentI come in peace  With that he leaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale stood face to face with the captain  Cross your arms sir throw back your head  Now repeat after me As soon as Steelkilt leaves me I swear to beach this boat on yonder island and remain there six days  If I do not may lightning strike me  A pretty scholar laughed the Lakeman  Adios Senor and leaping into the sea he swam back to his comrades  Watching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the roots of the cocoanut trees Steelkilt made sail again and in due time arrived at Tahiti his own place of destination  There luck befriended him two ships were about to sail for France and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed  They embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution  Some ten days after the French ships sailed the whaleboat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea  Chartering a small native schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all right there again resumed his cruisings  Where Steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island of Nantucket the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him  Are you through said Don Sebastian quietly  I am Don  Then I entreat you tell me if to the best of your own convictions this your story is in substance really true  It is so passing wonderful  Did you get it from an unquestionable source  Bear with me if I seem to press  Also bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in Don Sebastians suit cried the company with exceeding interest  Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn gentlemen  Nay said Don Sebastian but I know a worthy priest near by who will quickly procure one for me  I go for it but are you well advised this may grow too serious  Will you be so good as to bring the priest also Don  Though there are no AutodaFes in Lima now said one of the company to another I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy  Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight  I see no need of this  Excuse me for running after you Don Sebastian but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you canThis is the priest he brings you the Evangelists said Don Sebastian gravely returning with a tall and solemn figure  Let me remove my hat  Now venerable priest further into the light and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it  So help me Heaven and on my honour the story I have told ye gentlemen is in substance and its great items true  I know it to be true it happened on this ball I trod the ship I knew the crew I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney CHAPTER 55  Of the Monstrous Pictures of WhalesI shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there  It may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman  It is time to set the world right in this matter by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong  It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest Hindoo Egyptian and Grecian sculptures  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples the pedestals of statues and on shields medallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn in scales of chainarmor like Saladins and a helmeted head like St Georges ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed not only in most popular pictures of the whale but in many scientific presentations of him  Now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whales is to be found in the famous cavernpagoda of Elephanta in India  The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda all the trades and pursuits every conceivable avocation of man were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being  No wonder then that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth  The Hindoo whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known as the Matse Avatar  But though this sculpture is half man and half whale so as only to give the tail of the latter yet that small section of him is all wrong  It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the broad palms of the true whales majestic flukes  But go to the old Galleries and look now at a great Christian painters portrait of this fish for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo  It is Guidos picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the seamonster or whale  Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that  Nor does Hogarth in painting the same scene in his own Perseus Descending make out one whit better  The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface scarcely drawing one inch of water  It has a sort of howdah on its back and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling might be taken for the Traitors Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower  Then there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald and Jonahs whale as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers What shall be said of these  As for the bookbinders whale winding like a vinestalk round the stock of a descending anchoras stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages of many books both old and newthat is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature imitated I take it from the like figures on antique vases  Though universally denominated a dolphin I nevertheless call this bookbinders fish an attempt at a whale because it was so intended when the device was first introduced  It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century during the Revival of Learning and in those days and even down to a comparatively late period dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan  In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where all manner of spouts jets deau hot springs and cold Saratoga and BadenBaden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain  In the titlepage of the original edition of the Advancement of Learning you will find some curious whales  But quitting all these unprofessional attempts let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober scientific delineations by those who know  In old Harriss collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages AD 1671 entitled A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale Peter Peterson of Friesland master In one of those plates the whales like great rafts of logs are represented lying among iceisles with white bears running over their living backs  In another plate the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes  Then again there is an imposing quarto written by one Captain Colnett a Post Captain in the English navy entitled A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries  In this book is an outline purporting to be a Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico August 1793 and hoisted on deck  I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines  To mention but one thing about it let me say that it has an eye which applied according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bowwindow some five feet long  Ah my gallant captain why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye  Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of mistake  Look at that popular work Goldsmiths Animated Nature In the abridged London edition of 1807 there are plates of an alleged whale and a narwhale  I do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow and as for the narwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys  Then again in 1825 Bernard Germain Count de Lacepede a great naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan  All these are not only incorrect but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale that is to say the Right whale even Scoresby a long experienced man as touching that species declares not to have its counterpart in nature  But the placing of the capsheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier brother to the famous Baron  In 1836 he published a Natural History of Whales in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale  Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket  In a word Frederick Cuviers Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale but a squash  Of course he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived that picture who can tell  Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field Desmarest got one of his authentic abortions that is from a Chinese drawing  And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are many queer cups and saucers inform us  As for the signpainters whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oildealers what shall be said of them  They are generally Richard III whales with dromedary humps and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full of mariners their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint  But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all  Consider  Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars  Though elephants have stood for their fulllengths the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait  The living whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launched lineofbattle ship and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations  And not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a fullgrown Platonian Leviathan yet even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ships deck such is then the outlandish eellike limbered varying shape of him that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch  But it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form  Not at all  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape Though Jeremy Benthams skeleton which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors correctly conveys the idea of a burlybrowed utilitarian old gentleman with all Jeremys other leading personal characteristics yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathans articulated bones  In fact as the great Hunter says the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it  This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown  It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand minus only the thumb  This fin has four regular bonefingers the index middle ring and little finger  But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering as the human fingers in an artificial covering  However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us said humorous Stubb one day he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens  For all these reasons then any way you may look at it you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last  True one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness  So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like  And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him Wherefore it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan CHAPTER 56  Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales and the True Pictures of Whaling ScenesIn connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books both ancient and modern especially in Pliny Purchas Hackluyt Harris Cuvier etc  But I pass that matter by  I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale Colnetts Hugginss Frederick Cuviers and Beales  In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to  Hugginss is far better than theirs but by great odds Beales is the best All Beales drawings of this whale are good excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes capping his second chapter  His frontispiece boats attacking Sperm Whales though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is admirably correct and lifelike in its general effect Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J  Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour but they are wretchedly engraved  That is not his fault though  Of the Right Whale the best outline pictures are in Scoresby but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression He has but one picture of whaling scenes and this is a sad deficiency because it is by such pictures only when at all well done that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters  But taken for all in all by far the finest though in some details not the most correct presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found are two large French engravings well executed and taken from paintings by one Garnery  Respectively they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale  In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks  The prow of the boat is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon the monsters spine and standing in that prow for that one single incomputable flash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale and in the act of leaping as if from a precipice  The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true  The halfemptied linetub floats on the whitened sea the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me I could not draw so good a one  In the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rockslide from the Patagonian cliffs  His jets are erect full and black like soot so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below  Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs shellfish and other sea candies and maccaroni which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back  And all the while the thicklipped leviathan is rushing through the deep leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddlewheels of an ocean steamer  Thus the foreground is all raging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is the glassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whalepole inserted into his spouthole  Who Garnery the painter is or was I know not  But my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman  The French are the lads for painting action  Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas as in that triumphal hall at Versailles where the beholder fights his way pellmell through the consecutive great battles of France where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by like a charge of crowned centaurs  Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery are these sea battlepieces of Garnery  The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes  With not one tenth of Englands experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt  For the most part the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid  Even Scoresby the justly renowned Right whaleman after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives and grapnels and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninetysix facsimiles of magnified Arctic snow crystals  I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager I honour him for a veteran but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace  In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery there are two other French engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself H  Durand  One of them though not precisely adapted to our present purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts It is a quiet noonscene among the isles of the Pacific a French whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background both drooping together in the breezeless air  The effect is very fine when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose  The other engraving is quite a different affair the ship hoveto upon the open sea and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life with a Right Whale alongside the vessel in the act of cuttingin hove over to the monster as if to a quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is about giving chase to whales in the distance  The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stands halferect out of the water like a rearing horse  From the ship the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies and to windward a black cloud rising up with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen CHAPTER 57  Of Whales in Paint in Teeth in Wood in SheetIron in Stone in Mountains in StarsOn Towerhill as you go down to the London docks you may have seen a crippled beggar or KEDGER as the sailors say holding a painted board before him representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg  There are three whales and three boats and one of the boats presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale  Any time these ten years they tell me has that man held up that picture and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world  But the time of his justification has now come  His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping at any rate and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings But though for ever mounted on that stump never a stumpspeech does the poor whaleman make but with downcast eyes stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation  Throughout the Pacific and also in Nantucket and New Bedford and Sag Harbor you will come across lively sketches of whales and whalingscenes graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whaleteeth or ladies busks wrought out of the Right Whalebone and other like skrimshander articles as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material in their hours of ocean leisure  Some of them have little boxes of dentisticallooking implements specially intended for the skrimshandering business  But in general they toil with their jackknives alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor they will turn you out anything you please in the way of a mariners fancy  Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which God placed him ie what is called savagery  Your true whalehunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois I myself am a savage owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals and ready at any moment to rebel against him  Now one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours is his wonderful patience of industry  An ancient Hawaiian warclub or spearpaddle in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon  For with but a bit of broken seashell or a sharks tooth that miraculous intricacy of wooden network has been achieved and it has cost steady years of steady application  As with the Hawaiian savage so with the white sailorsavage  With the same marvellous patience and with the same single sharks tooth of his one poor jackknife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture not quite as workmanlike but as close packed in its maziness of design as the Greek savage Achilless shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage Albert Durer  Wooden whales or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea warwood are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers  Some of them are done with much accuracy  At some old gableroofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the roadside door  When the porter is sleepy the anvilheaded whale would be best  But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays  On the spires of some oldfashioned churches you will see sheetiron whales placed there for weathercocks but they are so elevated and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with HANDS OFF you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit  In bony ribby regions of the earth where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges  Then again in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges  But you must be a thorough whaleman to see these sights and not only that but if you wish to return to such a sight again you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first standpoint else so chancelike are such observations of the hills that your precise previous standpoint would require a laborious rediscovery like the Soloma Islands which still remain incognita though once highruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them  Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds  Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me  And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the ArgoNavis and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish  With a frigates anchors for my bridlebitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight CHAPTER 58  BritSteering northeastward from the Crozetts we fell in with vast meadows of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the Right Whale largely feeds  For leagues and leagues it undulated round us so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat  On the second day numbers of Right Whales were seen who secure from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit which adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip  As morning mowers who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads even so these monsters swam making a strange grassy cutting sound and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow seaThat part of the sea known among whalemen as the Brazil Banks does not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do because of there being shallows and soundings there but because of this remarkable meadowlike appearance caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes where the Right Whale is often chasedBut it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers  Seen from the mastheads especially when they paused and were stationary for a while their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else And as in the great hunting countries of India the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such taking them for bare blackened elevations of the soil even so often with him who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea  And even when recognised at last their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all parts with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse  Indeed in other respects you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore  For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of the thing this may very well be yet coming to specialties where for example does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog  The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him  But though to landsmen in general the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one though by vast odds the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters though but a moments consideration will teach that however baby man may brag of his science and skill and however much in a flattering future that science and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom the sea will insult and murder him and pulverize the stateliest stiffest frigate he can make nevertheless by the continual repetition of these very impressions man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it  The first boat we read of floated on an ocean that with Portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow  That same ocean rolls now that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year  Yea foolish mortals Noahs flood is not yet subsided two thirds of the fair world it yet covers  Wherein differ the sea and the land that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other  Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun ever sets but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews  But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it but it is also a fiend to its own offspring worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned  Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships  No mercy no power but its own controls it Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider the masterless ocean overruns the globe  Consider the subtleness of the sea how its most dreaded creatures glide under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure  Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks Consider once more the universal cannibalism of the sea all whose creatures prey upon each other carrying on eternal war since the world began  Consider all this and then turn to this green gentle and most docile earth consider them both the sea and the land and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself  For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti full of peace and joy but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life  God keep thee  Push not off from that isle thou canst never returnCHAPTER 59  SquidSlowly wading through the meadows of brit the Pequod still held on her way northeastward towards the island of Java a gentle air impelling her keel so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze as three mild palms on a plain  And still at wide intervals in the silvery night the lonely alluring jet would be seen  But one transparent blue morning when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea however unattended with any stagnant calm when the long burnished sunglade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them enjoining some secrecy when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the mainmasthead  In the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higher and higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamed before our prow like a snowslide new slid from the hills  Thus glistening for a moment as slowly it subsided and sank  Then once more arose and silently gleamed  It seemed not a whale and yet is this Moby Dick thought Daggoo  Again the phantom went down but on reappearing once more with a stilettolike cry that startled every man from his nod the negro yelled outThere there again there she breaches right ahead  The White Whale the White Whale  Upon this the seamen rushed to the yardarms as in swarmingtime the bees rush to the boughs  Bareheaded in the sultry sun Ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo  Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon Ahab so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued however this was or whether his eagerness betrayed him whichever way it might have been no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering  The four boats were soon on the water Ahabs in advance and all swiftly pulling towards their prey  Soon it went down and while with oars suspended we were awaiting its reappearance lo in the same spot where it sank once more it slowly rose  Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind  A vast pulpy mass furlongs in length and breadth of a glancing creamcolour lay floating on the water innumerable long arms radiating from its centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach  No perceptible face or front did it have no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct but undulated there on the billows an unearthly formless chancelike apparition of life  As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wild voice exclaimedAlmost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him than to have seen thee thou white ghost  What was it Sir said Flask  The great live squid which they say few whaleships ever beheld and returned to their ports to tell of it  But Ahab said nothing turning his boat he sailed back to the vessel the rest as silently following  Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of it being so very unusual that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness  So rarely is it beheld that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food  For though other species of whales find their food above water and may be seen by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what precisely that food consists  At times when closely pursued he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length  They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other species is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it  There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid  The manner in which the Bishop describes it as alternately rising and sinking with some other particulars he narrates in all this the two correspond  But much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it  By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature here spoken of it is included among the class of cuttlefish to which indeed in certain external respects it would seem to belong but only as the Anak of the tribe CHAPTER 60  The LineWith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented I have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whaleline  The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp slightly vapoured with tar not impregnated with it as in the case of ordinary ropes for while tar as ordinarily used makes the hemp more pliable to the ropemaker and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whaleline for the close coiling to which it must be subjected but as most seamen are beginning to learn tar in general by no means adds to the ropes durability or strength however much it may give it compactness and gloss  Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whalelines for though not so durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic and I will add since there is an aesthetics in all things is much more handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp  Hemp is a dusky dark fellow a sort of Indian but Manilla is as a goldenhaired Circassian to behold  The whaleline is only twothirds of an inch in thickness  At first sight you would not think it so strong as it really is  By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons  In length the common sperm whaleline measures something over two hundred fathoms  Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub not like the wormpipe of a still though but so as to form one round cheeseshaped mass of densely bedded sheaves or layers of concentric spiralizations without any hollow but the heart or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese  As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take somebodys arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub  Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists  In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs  There is some advantage in this because these twintubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat and do not strain it so much whereas the American tub nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one halfinch in thickness for the bottom of the whaleboat is like critical ice which will bear up a considerable distributed weight but not very much of a concentrated one  When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American linetub the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great weddingcake to present to the whales  Both ends of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an eyesplice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts First In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon  In these instances the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale as it were from the one boat to the other though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort  Second This arrangement is indispensable for common safetys sake for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking minute as he sometimes does he would not stop there for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea and in that case no towncrier would ever find her again  Before lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there is again carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every mans oar so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing and also passing between the men as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill prevents it from slipping out  From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows and is then passed inside the boat again and some ten or twenty fathoms called boxline being coiled upon the box in the bows it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft and is then attached to the shortwarpthe rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon but previous to that connexion the shortwarp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail  Thus the whaleline folds the whole boat in its complicated coils twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction  All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions so that to the timid eye of the landsman they seem as Indian jugglers with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs  Nor can any son of mortal woman for the first time seat himself amid those hempen intricacies and while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly  Yet habitstrange thing what cannot habit accomplishGayer sallies more merry mirth better jokes and brighter repartees you never heard over your mahogany than you will hear over the halfinch white cedar of the whaleboat when thus hung in hangmans nooses and like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death with a halter around every neck as you may say  Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasterssome few of which are casually chronicledof this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line and lost  For when the line is darting out to be seated then in the boat is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steamengine in full play when every flying beam and shaft and wheel is grazing you  It is worse for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils because the boat is rocking like a cradle and you are pitched one way and the other without the slightest warning and only by a certain selfadjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action can you escape being made a Mazeppa of and run away with where the allseeing sun himself could never pierce you out  Again as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself for indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and contains it in itself as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the line as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual playthis is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair  But why say more  All men live enveloped in whalelines  All are born with halters round their necks but it is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death that mortals realize the silent subtle everpresent perils of life  And if you be a philosopher though seated in the whaleboat you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seated before your evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by your side CHAPTER 61  Stubb Kills a WhaleIf to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents to Queequeg it was quite a different object  When you see him quid said the savage honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat then you quick see him parm whale  The next day was exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special to engage them the Pequods crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea  For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground that is it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises dolphins flyingfish and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters than those off the Rio de la Plata or the inshore ground off Peru  It was my turn to stand at the foremasthead and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air  No resolution could withstand it in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness at last my soul went out of my body though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn  Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me I had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzenmastheads were already drowsy  So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman  The waves too nodded their indolent crests and across the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all  Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes like vices my hands grasped the shrouds some invisible gracious agency preserved me with a shock I came back to life  And lo close under our lee not forty fathoms off a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an Ethiopian hue glistening in the suns rays like a mirror  But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon  But that pipe poor whale was thy last  As if struck by some enchanters wand the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel simultaneously with the three notes from aloft shouted forth the accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air  Clear away the boats  Luff cried Ahab  And obeying his own order he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes  The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boats were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripples as he swam that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whispers  So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats we swiftly but silently paddled along the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set  Presently as we thus glided in chase the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up  There go flukes was the cry an announcement immediately followed by Stubbs producing his match and igniting his pipe for now a respite was granted  After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed the whale rose again and being now in advance of the smokers boat and much nearer to it than to any of the others Stubb counted upon the honour of the capture  It was obvious now that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers  All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use  Paddles were dropped and oars came loudly into play  And still puffing at his pipe Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault  Yes a mighty change had come over the fish  All alive to his jeopardy he was going head out that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewedIt will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whales enormous head consists Though apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about him  So that with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed  Besides such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head and such the tapering cutwater formation of the lower part that by obliquely elevating his head he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluffbowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilotboatStart her start her my men  Dont hurry yourselves take plenty of timebut start her start her like thunderclaps thats all cried Stubb spluttering out the smoke as he spoke  Start her now give em the long and strong stroke Tashtego  Start her Tash my boystart her all but keep cool keep coolcucumbers is the wordeasy easyonly start her like grim death and grinning devils and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves boysthats all  Start her  Woohoo  Wahee screamed the GayHeader in reply raising some old warwhoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave  But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild Keehee  Keehee yelled Daggoo straining forwards and backwards on his seat like a pacing tiger in his cage  Kala  Kooloo howled Queequeg as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of Grenadiers steak  And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea  Meanwhile Stubb retaining his place in the van still encouraged his men to the onset all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth  Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry was heardStand up Tashtegogive it to him  The harpoon was hurled  Stern all  The oarsmen backed water the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists  It was the magical line  An instant before Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of its increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe  As the line passed round and round the loggerhead so also just before reaching that point it blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubbs hands from which the handcloths or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times had accidentally dropped  It was like holding an enemys sharp twoedged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch  Wet the line wet the line cried Stubb to the tub oarsman him seated by the tub who snatching off his hat dashed seawater into it  More turns were taken so that the line began holding its place The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins Stubb and Tashtego here changed placesstem for sterna staggering business truly in that rocking commotionPartly to show the indispensableness of this act it may here be stated that in the old Dutch fishery a mop was used to dash the running line with water in many other ships a wooden piggin or bailer is set apart for that purpose  Your hat however is the most convenientFrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring you would have thought the craft had two keelsone cleaving the water the other the airas the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once  A continual cascade played at the bows a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of a little finger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea  Thus they rushed each man with might and main clinging to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double in order to bring down his centre of gravity  Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight  Haul inhaul in cried Stubb to the bowsman and facing round towards the whale all hands began pulling the boat up to him while yet the boat was being towed on  Soon ranging up by his flank Stubb firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whales horrible wallow and then ranging up for another fling  The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill  His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake  The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflection into every face so that they all glowed to each other like red men  And all the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it Stubb straightened it again and again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again and again sent it into the whale  Pull uppull up he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath  Pull upclose to and the boat ranged along the fishs flank  When reaching far over the bow Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish and kept it there carefully churning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out  But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish  And now it is struck for starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry the monster horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in impenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping astern had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day  And now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting his spouthole with sharp cracking agonized respirations  At last gush after gush of clotted red gore as if it had been the purple lees of red wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea  His heart had burst  Hes dead Mr Stubb said Daggoo  Yes both pipes smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouth Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made CHAPTER 62  The DartA word concerning an incident in the last chapter  According to the invariable usage of the fishery the whaleboat pushes off from the ship with the headsman or whalekiller as temporary steersman and the harpooneer or whalefastener pulling the foremost oar the one known as the harpooneeroar  Now it needs a strong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what is called a long dart the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet  But however prolonged and exhausting the chase the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost indeed he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations and what it is to keep shouting at the top of ones compass while all the other muscles are strained and half startedwhat that is none know but those who have tried it  For one I cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time  In this straining bawling state then with his back to the fish all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cryStand up and give it to him  He now has to drop and secure his oar turn round on his centre half way seize his harpoon from the crotch and with what little strength may remain he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale  No wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body that out of fifty fair chances for a dart not five are successful no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated no wonder that some of them actually burst their bloodvessels in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels no wonder that to many ship owners whaling is but a losing concern for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted  Again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant that is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else  It is then they change places and the headsman the chief officer of the little craft takes his proper station in the bows of the boat  Now I care not who maintains the contrary but all this is both foolish and unnecessary  The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last he should both dart the harpoon and the lance and no rowing whatever should be expected of him except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman  I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them  To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness and not from out of toil CHAPTER 63  The CrotchOut of the trunk the branches grow out of them the twigs  So in productive subjects grow the chapters  The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention  It is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two feet in length which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly projects from the prow  Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall  It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch respectively called the first and second irons  But these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected with the line the object being this to dart them both if possible one instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold It is a doubling of the chances  But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however lightninglike in his movements to pitch the second iron into him  Nevertheless as the second iron is already connected with the line and the line is running hence that weapon must at all events be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands  Tumbled into the water it accordingly is in such cases the spare coils of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instances prudently practicable  But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties  Furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharpedged terror skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the lines or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all directions  Nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse  Consider now how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to these qualities in him as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him  For of course each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery  All these particulars are faithfully narrated here as they will not fail to elucidate several most important however intricate passages in scenes hereafter to be painted CHAPTER 64  Stubbs SupperStubbs whale had been killed some distance from the ship  It was a calm so forming a tandem of three boats we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod  And now as we eighteen men with our thirtysix arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except at long intervals good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved  For upon the great canal of HangHo or whatever they call it in China four or five laborers on the footpath will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along as if laden with piglead in bulk  Darkness came on but three lights up and down in the Pequods mainrigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks  Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning  Though in overseeing the pursuit of this whale Captain Ahab had evinced his customary activity to call it so yet now that the creature was dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seemed working in him as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship all that would not one jot advance his grand monomaniac object  Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequods decks that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck and thrust rattling out of the portholes But by those clanking links the vast corpse itself not the ship is to be moored  Tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessels and seen through the darkness of the night which obscured the spars and rigging aloft the twoship and whale seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks whereof one reclines while the other remains standingA little item may as well be related here  The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other excepting the sidefins its flexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to put the chain round it  But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a small strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end and a weight in its middle while the other end is secured to the ship  By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readily made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobesIf moody Ahab was now all quiescence at least so far as could be known on deck Stubb his second mate flushed with conquest betrayed an unusual but still goodnatured excitement  Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck his official superior quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs  One small helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb was soon made strangely manifest  Stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate  A steak a steak ere I sleep  You Daggoo overboard you go and cut me one from his small  Here be it known that though these wild fishermen do not as a general thing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body  About midnight that steak was cut and cooked and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstanhead as if that capstan were a sideboard  Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whales flesh that night  Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications thousands on thousands of sharks swarming round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted on its fatness  The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the sleepers hearts  Peering over the side you could just see them as before you heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head  This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous  How at such an apparently unassailable surface they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the universal problem of all things  The mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw  Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a seafight sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ships decks like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant butchers over the decktable are thus cannibally carving each others live meat with carvingknives all gilded and tasselled the sharks also with their jewelhilted mouths are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thing that is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic systematically trotting alongside to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slave to be decently buried and though one or two other like instances might be set down touching the set terms places and occasions when sharks do most socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers and in gayer or more jovial spirits than around a dead sperm whale moored by night to a whaleship at sea  If you have never seen that sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of devilworship and the expediency of conciliating the devil  But as yet Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips  Cook cookwheres that old Fleece he cried at length widening his legs still further as if to form a more secure base for his supper and at the same time darting his fork into the dish as if stabbing with his lance cook you cooksail this way cook  The old black not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour came shambling along from his galley for like many old blacks there was something the matter with his kneepans which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans this old Fleece as they called him came shuffling and limping along assisting his step with his tongs which after a clumsy fashion were made of straightened iron hoops this old Ebony floundered along and in obedience to the word of command came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubbs sideboard when with both hands folded before him and resting on his twolegged cane he bowed his arched back still further over at the same time sideways inclining his head so as to bring his best ear into play  Cook said Stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth dont you think this steak is rather overdone  Youve been beating this steak too much cook its too tender  Dont I always say that to be good a whalesteak must be tough  There are those sharks now over the side dont you see they prefer it tough and rare  What a shindy they are kicking up  Cook go and talk to em tell em they are welcome to help themselves civilly and in moderation but they must keep quiet  Blast me if I can hear my own voice  Away cook and deliver my message  Here take this lantern snatching one from his sideboard now then go and preach to em  Sullenly taking the offered lantern old Fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks and then with one hand dropping his light low over the sea so as to get a good view of his congregation with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks while Stubb softly crawling behind overheard all that was said  Fellowcritters Ise ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare  You hear  Stop dat dam smackin ob de lips  Massa Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings but by Gor you must stop dat dam racket  Cook here interposed Stubb accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulderCook why damn your eyes you mustnt swear that way when youre preaching  Thats no way to convert sinners cook  Who dat  Den preach to him yourself sullenly turning to go  No cook go on go on  Well den Belubed fellowcritters  Right exclaimed Stubb approvingly coax em to it try that and Fleece continued  Do you is all sharks and by natur wery woracious yet I zay to you fellowcritters dat dat woraciousnesstop dat dam slappin ob de tail  How you tink to hear spose you keep up such a dam slappin and bitin dare  Cook cried Stubb collaring him I wont have that swearing Talk to em gentlemanly  Once more the sermon proceeded  Your woraciousness fellowcritters I dont blame ye so much for dat is natur and cant be helped but to gobern dat wicked natur dat is de pint  You is sharks sartin but if you gobern de shark in you why den you be angel for all angel is noting more dan de shark well goberned  Now look here bredren just try wonst to be cibil a helping yourselbs from dat whale  Dont be tearin de blubber out your neighbours mout I say  Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale  And by Gor none on you has de right to dat whale dat whale belong to some one else  I know some o you has berry brig mout brigger dan oders but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks dat cant get into de scrouge to help demselves  Well done old Fleece cried Stubb thats Christianity go on  No use goin on de dam willains will keep a scougin and slappin each oder Massa Stubb dey dont hear one word no use apreaching to such dam guttons as you call em till dare bellies is full and dare bellies is bottomless and when dey do get em full dey wont hear you den for den dey sink in the sea go fast to sleep on de coral and cant hear noting at all no more for eber and eber  Upon my soul I am about of the same opinion so give the benediction Fleece and Ill away to my supper  Upon this Fleece holding both hands over the fishy mob raised his shrill voice and cried  Cussed fellowcritters  Kick up de damndest row as ever you can fill your dam bellies till dey bustand den die  Now cook said Stubb resuming his supper at the capstan stand just where you stood before there over against me and pay particular attention  All dention said Fleece again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position  Well said Stubb helping himself freely meanwhile I shall now go back to the subject of this steak  In the first place how old are you cook  What dat do wid de teak said the old black testily  Silence  How old are you cook  Bout ninety dey say he gloomily muttered  And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years cook and dont know yet how to cook a whalesteak rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question  Where were you born cook  Hind de hatchway in ferryboat goin ober de Roanoke  Born in a ferryboat  Thats queer too  But I want to know what country you were born in cook  Didnt I say de Roanoke country he cried sharply  No you didnt cook but Ill tell you what Im coming to cook You must go home and be born over again you dont know how to cook a whalesteak yet  Bress my soul if I cook noder one he growled angrily turning round to depart  Come back here cookhere hand me those tongsnow take that bit of steak there and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be  Take it I sayholding the tongs towards himtake it and taste it  Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment the old negro muttered Best cooked teak I eber taste joosy berry joosy  Cook said Stubb squaring himself once more do you belong to the church  Passed one once in CapeDown said the old man sullenly  And you have once in your life passed a holy church in CapeTown where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellowcreatures have you cook  And yet you come here and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now eh said Stubb Where do you expect to go to cook  Go to bed berry soon he mumbled halfturning as he spoke  Avast heave to  I mean when you die cook  Its an awful question  Now whats your answer  When dis old brack man dies said the negro slowly changing his whole air and demeanor he hisself wont go nowhere but some bressed angel will come and fetch him  Fetch him  How  In a coach and four as they fetched Elijah  And fetch him where  Up dere said Fleece holding his tongs straight over his head and keeping it there very solemnly  So then you expect to go up into our maintop do you cook when you are dead  But dont you know the higher you climb the colder it gets  Maintop eh  Didnt say dat tall said Fleece again in the sulks  You said up there didnt you and now look yourself and see where your tongs are pointing  But perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubbers hole cook but no no cook you dont get there except you go the regular way round by the rigging Its a ticklish business but must be done or else its no go  But none of us are in heaven yet  Drop your tongs cook and hear my orders  Do ye hear  Hold your hat in one hand and clap tother atop of your heart when Im giving my orders cook  What that your heart therethats your gizzard  Aloft aloftthats itnow you have it  Hold it there now and pay attention  All dention said the old black with both hands placed as desired vainly wriggling his grizzled head as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time  Well then cook you see this whalesteak of yours was so very bad that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible you see that dont you  Well for the future when you cook another whalesteak for my private table here the capstan Ill tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing  Hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal to it with the other that done dish it dye hear And now tomorrow cook when we are cutting in the fish be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins have them put in pickle As for the ends of the flukes have them soused cook  There now ye may go  But Fleece had hardly got three paces off when he was recalled  Cook give me cutlets for supper tomorrow night in the midwatch Dye hear away you sail thenHalloa stop make a bow before you goAvast heaving again  Whaleballs for breakfastdont forget  Wish by gor whale eat him stead of him eat whale  Im bressed if he aint more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself muttered the old man limping away with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock CHAPTER 65  The Whale as a DishThat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp and like Stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it  It is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France and commanded large prices there  Also that in Henry VIIIths time a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a species of whale  Porpoises indeed are to this day considered fine eating  The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtleballs or veal balls  The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them  They had a great porpoise grant from the crown  The fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but when you come to sit down before a meatpie nearly one hundred feet long it takes away your appetite  Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious  We all know how they live upon whales and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil  Zogranda one of their most famous doctors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing  And this reminds me that certain Englishmen who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vesselthat these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber  Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called fritters which indeed they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives doughnuts or olycooks when fresh  They have such an eatable look that the most selfdenying stranger can hardly keep his hands off  But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his exceeding richness  He is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good  Look at his hump which would be as fine eating as the buffalos which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solid pyramid of fat  But the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy that is like the transparent halfjellied white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter  Nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of it In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their shipbiscuit into the huge oilpots and let them fry there awhile  Many a good supper have I thus made  In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish  The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two plump whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two large puddings they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a most delectable mess in flavor somewhat resembling calves head which is quite a dish among some epicures and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures by continually dining upon calves brains by and by get to have a little brains of their own so as to be able to tell a calfs head from their own heads which indeed requires uncommon discrimination  And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calfs head before him is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see  The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him with an Et tu Brute expression  It is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence that appears to result in some way from the consideration before mentioned ie that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea and eat it too by its own light  But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer perhaps he was hung and if he had been put on his trial by oxen he certainly would have been and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does  Go to the meatmarket of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds  Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibals jaw  Cannibals who is not a cannibal  I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee I say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized and enlightened gourmand who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy patedefoiegras  But Stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is adding insult to injury is it  Look at your knifehandle there my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is that handle made ofwhat but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating  And what do you pick your teeth with after devouring that fat goose  With a feather of the same fowl  And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars  It is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronise nothing but steel pens CHAPTER 66  The Shark MassacreWhen in the Southern Fishery a captured Sperm Whale after long and weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a general thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in  For that business is an exceedingly laborious one is not very soon completed and requires all hands to set about it  Therefore the common usage is to take in all sail lash the helm alee and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservation that until that time anchorwatches shall be kept that is two and two for an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well  But sometimes especially upon the Line in the Pacific this plan will not answer at all because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase that were he left so for six hours say on a stretch little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning  In most other parts of the ocean however where these fish do not so largely abound their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whalingspades a procedure notwithstanding which in some instances only seems to tickle them into still greater activity But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequods sharks though to be sure any man unaccustomed to such sights to have looked over her side that night would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese and those sharks the maggots in it  Nevertheless upon Stubb setting the anchorwatch after his supper was concluded and when accordingly Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck no small excitement was created among the sharks for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side and lowering three lanterns so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea these two mariners darting their long whalingspades kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls seemingly their only vital part  But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts the marksmen could not always hit their mark and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe  They viciously snapped not only at each others disembowelments but like flexible bows bent round and bit their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound  Nor was this all  It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures  A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones after what might be called the individual life had departed  Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin one of these sharks almost took poor Queequegs hand off when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jawThe whalingspade used for cuttingin is made of the very best steel is about the bigness of a mans spread hand and in general shape corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named only its sides are perfectly flat and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower  This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible and when being used is occasionally honed just like a razor  In its socket a stiff pole from twenty to thirty feet long is inserted for a handleQueequeg no care what god made him shark said the savage agonizingly lifting his hand up and down wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin CHAPTER 67  Cutting InIt was a Saturday night and such a Sabbath as followed  Ex officio professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen  The ivory Pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble every sailor a butcher  You would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods  In the first place the enormous cutting tackles among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green and which no single man can possibly liftthis vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the maintop and firmly lashed to the lower masthead the strongest point anywhere above a ships deck  The end of the hawserlike rope winding through these intricacies was then conducted to the windlass and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale to this block the great blubber hook weighing some one hundred pounds was attached  And now suspended in stages over the side Starbuck and Stubb the mates armed with their long spades began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two sidefins  This done a broad semicircular line is cut round the hole the hook is inserted and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass  When instantly the entire ship careens over on her side every bolt in her starts like the nailheads of an old house in frosty weather she trembles quivers and nods her frighted mastheads to the sky  More and more she leans over to the whale while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber  Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the scarf simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb the mates and just as fast as it is thus peeled off and indeed by that very act itself it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the maintop the men at the windlass then cease heaving and for a moment or two the prodigious blooddripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard  One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long keen weapon called a boardingsword and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass  Into this hole the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare for what follows  Whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning all hands to stand off once more makes a scientific dash at the mass and with a few sidelong desperate lunging slicings severs it completely in twain so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip called a blanketpiece swings clear and is all ready for lowering  The heavers forward now resume their song and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other is slowly slackened away and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubberroom  Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanketpiece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents  And thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heavers singing the blubberroom gentlemen coiling the mates scarfing the ship straining and all hands swearing occasionally by way of assuaging the general friction CHAPTER 68  The BlanketI have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin of the whale  I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat and learned naturalists ashore  My original opinion remains unchanged but it is only an opinion  The question is what and where is the skin of the whale  Already you know what his blubber is  That blubber is something of the consistence of firm closegrained beef but tougher more elastic and compact and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness  Now however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creatures skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whales body but that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal if reasonably dense what can that be but the skin  True from the unmarred dead body of the whale you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin transparent substance somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin that is previous to being dried when it not only contracts and thickens but becomes rather hard and brittle  I have several such dried bits which I use for marks in my whalebooks  It is transparent as I said before and being laid upon the printed page I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence  At any rate it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles as you may say  But what I am driving at here is this  That same infinitely thin isinglass substance which I admit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so to speak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a newborn child But no more of this  Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that in quantity or rather weight that oil in its expressed state is only three fourths and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that Reckoning ten barrels to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whales skin  In life the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents  Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and recrossed with numberless straight marks in thick array something like those in the finest Italian line engravings  But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned but seem to be seen through it as if they were engraved upon the body itself  Nor is this all  In some instances to the quick observant eye those linear marks as in a veritable engraving but afford the ground for far other delineations  These are hieroglyphical that is if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion  By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi  Like those mystic rocks too the mysticmarked whale remains undecipherable  This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another thing  Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents he not seldom displays the back and more especially his flanks effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratches altogether of an irregular random aspect  I should say that those New England rocks on the seacoast which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergsI should say that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular  It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales for I have most remarked them in the large fullgrown bulls of the species  A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale  It has already been said that it is stript from him in long pieces called blanketpieces  Like most seaterms this one is very happy and significant  For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an Indian poncho slipt over his head and skirting his extremity  It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers in all seas times and tides  What would become of a Greenland whale say in those shuddering icy seas of the North if unsupplied with his cosy surtout  True other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters but these be it observed are your coldblooded lungless fish whose very bellies are refrigerators creatures that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire whereas like man the whale has lungs and warm blood  Freeze his blood and he dies  How wonderful is it thenexcept after explanationthat this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man how wonderful that he should be found at home immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters where when seamen fall overboard they are sometimes found months afterwards perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice as a fly is found glued in amber  But more surprising is it to know as has been proved by experiment that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer  It does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness  Oh man admire and model thyself after the whale  Do thou too remain warm among ice  Do thou too live in this world without being of it  Be cool at the equator keep thy blood fluid at the Pole  Like the great dome of St Peters and like the great whale retain O man in all seasons a temperature of thine own  But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things  Of erections how few are domed like St Peters of creatures how few vast as the whale CHAPTER 69  The FuneralHaul in the chains  Let the carcase go astern  The vast tackles have now done their duty  The peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre though changed in hue it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk  It is still colossal  Slowly it floats more and more away the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale  The vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship and every rod that it so floats what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls augment the murderous din  For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen  Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair face of the pleasant sea wafted by the joyous breezes that great mass of death floats on and on till lost in infinite perspectives  Theres a most doleful and most mocking funeral  The seavultures all in pious mourning the airsharks all punctiliously in black or speckled  In life but few of them would have helped the whale I ween if peradventure he had needed it but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce  Oh horrible vultureism of earth from which not the mightiest whale is free  Nor is this the end  Desecrated as the body is a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare  Espied by some timid manofwar or blundering discoveryvessel from afar when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun and the white spray heaving high against it straightway the whales unharming corpse with trembling fingers is set down in the logSHOALS ROCKS AND BREAKERS HEREABOUTS BEWARE  And for years afterwards perhaps ships shun the place leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held  Theres your law of precedents theres your utility of traditions theres the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth and now not even hovering in the air  Theres orthodoxy  Thus while in life the great whales body may have been a real terror to his foes in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world  Are you a believer in ghosts my friend  There are other ghosts than the CockLane one and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in them CHAPTER 70  The SphynxIt should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan he was beheaded  Now the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason  Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck on the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in that very place is the thickest part of him  Remember also that the surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea  Bear in mind too that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without so much as getting one single peep into the evercontracting gash thus made he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted parts and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull  Do you not marvel then at Stubbs boast that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale  When first severed the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped  That done if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of  But with a full grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whales head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk and completely to suspend such a burden as that even by the immense tackles of a whaler this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers scales  The Pequods whale being decapitated and the body stripped the head was hoisted against the ships sideabout half way out of the sea so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element  And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower masthead and every yardarm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves there that blooddripping head hung to the Pequods waist like the giant Holoferness from the girdle of Judith  When this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen went below to their dinner  Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck  An intense copper calm like a universal yellow lotus was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea  A short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his cabin  Taking a few turns on the quarterdeck he paused to gaze over the side then slowly getting into the mainchains he took Stubbs long spadestill remaining there after the whales Decapitationand striking it into the lower part of the halfsuspended mass placed its other end crutchwise under one arm and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head  It was a black and hooded head and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm it seemed the Sphynxs in the desert  Speak thou vast and venerable head muttered Ahab which though ungarnished with a beard yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses speak mighty head and tell us the secret thing that is in thee  Of all divers thou hast dived the deepest  That head upon which the upper sun now gleams has moved amid this worlds foundations  Where unrecorded names and navies rust and untold hopes and anchors rot where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned there in that awful waterland there was thy most familiar home  Thou hast been where bell or diver never went hast slept by many a sailors side where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down  Thou sawst the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave true to each other when heaven seemed false to them  Thou sawst the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw and his murderers still sailed on unharmedwhile swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched longing arms O head thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham and not one syllable is thine  Sail ho cried a triumphant voice from the mainmasthead  Aye  Well now thats cheering cried Ahab suddenly erecting himself while whole thunderclouds swept aside from his brow  That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better manWhere away  Three points on the starboard bow sir and bringing down her breeze to us  Better and better man  Would now St Paul would come along that way and to my breezelessness bring his breeze  O Nature and O soul of man how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter but has its cunning duplicate in mind CHAPTER 71  The Jeroboams StoryHand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster than the ship and soon the Pequod began to rock  By and by through the glass the strangers boats and manned mastheads proved her a whaleship  But as she was so far to windward and shooting by apparently making a passage to some other ground the Pequod could not hope to reach her  So the signal was set to see what response would be made  Here be it said that like the vessels of military marines the ships of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached every captain is provided with it  Thereby the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean even at considerable distances and with no small facility  The Pequods signal was at last responded to by the strangers setting her own which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket  Squaring her yards she bore down ranged abeam under the Pequods lee and lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but as the sideladder was being rigged by Starbucks order to accommodate the visiting captain the stranger in question waved his hand from his boats stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board and that Mayhew her captain was fearful of infecting the Pequods company  For though himself and boats crew remained untainted and though his ship was half a rifleshot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod  But this did by no means prevent all communications  Preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship the Jeroboams boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod as she heavily forged through the sea for by this time it blew very fresh with her maintopsail aback though indeed at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave the boat would be pushed some way ahead but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again  Subject to this and other the like interruptions now and then a conversation was sustained between the two parties but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort  Pulling an oar in the Jeroboams boat was a man of a singular appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities  He was a small short youngish man sprinkled all over his face with freckles and wearing redundant yellow hair  A longskirted cabalisticallycut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists  A deep settled fanatic delirium was in his eyes  So soon as this figure had been first descried Stubb had exclaimedThats he thats hethe longtogged scaramouch the TownHos company told us of  Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time previous when the Pequod spoke the TownHo  According to this account and what was subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam  His story was this  He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trapdoor announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which he carried in his vestpocket but which instead of containing gunpowder was supposed to be charged with laudanum  A strange apostolic whim having seized him he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket where with that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steady commonsense exterior and offered himself as a greenhand candidate for the Jeroboams whaling voyage  They engaged him but straightway upon the ships getting out of sight of land his insanity broke out in a freshet  He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel and commanded the captain to jump overboard  He published his manifesto whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicargeneral of all Oceanica The unflinching earnestness with which he declared these thingsthe dark daring play of his sleepless excited imagination and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness  Moreover they were afraid of him  As such a man however was not of much practical use in the ship especially as he refused to work except when he pleased the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him but apprised that that individuals intention was to land him in the first convenient port the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vialsdevoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition in case this intention was carried out  So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship not a man of them would remain  He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan  Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what he would so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship  The consequence of all this was that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates and since the epidemic had broken out he carried a higher hand than ever declaring that the plague as he called it was at his sole command nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure  The sailors mostly poor devils cringed and some of them fawned before him in obedience to his instructions sometimes rendering him personal homage as to a god Such things may seem incredible but however wondrous they are true  Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless selfdeception of the fanatic himself as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others  But it is time to return to the Pequod  I fear not thy epidemic man said Ahab from the bulwarks to Captain Mayhew who stood in the boats stern come on board  But now Gabriel started to his feet  Think think of the fevers yellow and bilious  Beware of the horrible plague  Gabriel  Gabriel cried Captain Mayhew thou must either  But that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethings drowned all speech  Hast thou seen the White Whale demanded Ahab when the boat drifted back  Think think of thy whaleboat stoven and sunk  Beware of the horrible tail  I tell thee again Gabriel that  But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends  Nothing was said for some moments while a succession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling not heaving it Meantime the hoisted sperm whales head jogged about very violently and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant  When this interlude was over Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby Dick not however without frequent interruptions from Gabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him  It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home when upon speaking a whaleship her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby Dick and the havoc he had made  Greedily sucking in this intelligence Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering insanity pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated the Shakers receiving the Bible  But when some year or two afterwards Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mastheads Macey the chief mate burned with ardour to encounter him and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity despite all the archangels denunciations and forewarnings Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat With them he pushed off and after much weary pulling and many perilous unsuccessful onsets he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast  Meantime Gabriel ascending to the mainroyal masthead was tossing one arm in frantic gestures and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity  Now while Macey the mate was standing up in his boats bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen  Next instant the luckless mate so full of furious life was smitten bodily into the air and making a long arc in his descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards  Not a chip of the boat was harmed nor a hair of any oarsmans head but the mate for ever sank  It is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in the SpermWhale Fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any Sometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated oftener the boats bow is knocked off or the thighboard in which the headsman stands is torn from its place and accompanies the body But strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instances than one when the body has been recovered not a single mark of violence is discernible the man being stark dead  The whole calamity with the falling form of Macey was plainly descried from the ship  Raising a piercing shriekThe vial the vial  Gabriel called off the terrorstricken crew from the further hunting of the whale  This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically foreannounced it instead of only making a general prophecy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed  He became a nameless terror to the ship  Mayhew having concluded his narration Ahab put such questions to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the White Whale if opportunity should offer  To which Ahab answeredAye  Straightway then Gabriel once more started to his feet glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with downward pointed fingerThink think of the blasphemerdead and down therebeware of the blasphemers end  Ahab stolidly turned aside then said to Mayhew Captain I have just bethought me of my letterbag there is a letter for one of thy officers if I mistake not  Starbuck look over the bag  Every whaleship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans Thus most letters never reach their mark and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more  Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand  It was sorely tumbled damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin  Of such a letter Death himself might well have been the postboy  Canst not read it cried Ahab  Give it me man  Aye aye its but a dim scrawlwhats this  As he was studying it out Starbuck took a long cuttingspade pole and with his knife slightly split the end to insert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat without its coming any closer to the ship  Meantime Ahab holding the letter muttered Mr Haryes Mr Harrya womans pinny handthe mans wife Ill wagerAyeMr Harry Macey Ship Jeroboamwhy its Macey and hes dead  Poor fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed Mayhew but let me have it  Nay keep it thyself cried Gabriel to Ahab thou art soon going that way  Curses throttle thee yelled Ahab  Captain Mayhew stand by now to receive it and taking the fatal missive from Starbucks hands he caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the boat  But as he did so the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing the boat drifted a little towards the ships stern so that as if by magic the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriels eager hand  He clutched it in an instant seized the boatknife and impaling the letter on it sent it thus loaded back into the ship It fell at Ahabs feet  Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod  As after this interlude the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair CHAPTER 72  The MonkeyRopeIn the tumultuous business of cuttingin and attending to a whale there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew  Now hands are wanted here and then again hands are wanted there  There is no staying in any one place for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere  It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene  We must now retrace our way a little  It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whales back the blubberhook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates  But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole  It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg whose duty it was as harpooneer to descend upon the monsters back for the special purpose referred to  But in very many cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded  The whale be it observed lies almost entirely submerged excepting the immediate parts operated upon  So down there some ten feet below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounders about half on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves like a treadmill beneath him  On the occasion in question Queequeg figured in the Highland costumea shirt and socksin which to my eyes at least he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to observe him as will presently be seen  Being the savages bowsman that is the person who pulled the bowoar in his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hardscrabble scramble upon the dead whales back  You have seen Italian organboys holding a dancingape by a long cord  Just so from the ships steep side did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea by what is technically called in the fishery a monkeyrope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist  It was a humorously perilous business for both of us  For before we proceed further it must be said that the monkeyrope was fast at both ends fast to Queequegs broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow leather one  So that for better or for worse we two for the time were wedded and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage and honour demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should drag me down in his wake  So then an elongated Siamese ligature united us  Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed  So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then that while earnestly watching his motions I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two that my free will had received a mortal wound and that anothers mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death  Therefore I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence for its evenhanded equity never could have so gross an injustice  And yet still further ponderingwhile I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam himstill further pondering I say I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most cases he one way or other has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals  If your banker breaks you snap if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills you die  True you may say that by exceeding caution you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life  But handle Queequegs monkeyrope heedfully as I would sometimes he jerked it so that I came very near sliding overboard Nor could I possibly forget that do what I would I only had the management of one end of itThe monkeyrope is found in all whalers but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together  This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkeyrope holderI have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the shipwhere he would occasionally fall from the incessant rolling and swaying of both  But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to  Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcassthe rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive  And right in among those sharks was Queequeg who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet  A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man  Nevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them  Accordingly besides the monkeyrope with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious sharkhe was provided with still another protection  Suspended over the side in one of the stages Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whalespades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach  This procedure of theirs to be sure was very disinterested and benevolent of them  They meant Queequegs best happiness I admit but in their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the bloodmuddled water those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall  But poor Queequeg I suppose straining and gasping there with that great iron hookpoor Queequeg I suppose only prayed to his Yojo and gave up his life into the hands of his gods  Well well my dear comrade and twinbrother thought I as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the seawhat matters it after all  Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world  That unsounded ocean you gasp in is Life those sharks your foes those spades your friends and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad  But courage there is good cheer in store for you Queequeg  For now as with blue lips and bloodshot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side the steward advances and with a benevolent consolatory glance hands himwhat  Some hot Cognac  No hands him ye gods hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water  Ginger  Do I smell ginger suspiciously asked Stubb coming near Yes this must be ginger peering into the as yet untasted cup Then standing as if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying Ginger ginger and will you have the goodness to tell me Mr DoughBoy where lies the virtue of ginger  Ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use Doughboy to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal  Gingerwhat the devil is gingerseacoal firewoodlucifer matchestindergunpowderwhat the devil is ginger I say that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here  There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business he suddenly added now approaching Starbuck who had just come from forward  Will you look at that kannakin sir smell of it if you please  Then watching the mates countenance he added The steward Mr Starbuck had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg there this instant off the whale  Is the steward an apothecary sir and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a halfdrowned man  I trust not said Starbuck it is poor stuff enough  Aye aye steward cried Stubb well teach you to drug it harpooneer none of your apothecarys medicine here you want to poison us do ye  You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all and pocket the proceeds do ye  It was not me cried DoughBoy it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits but only this gingerjubso she called it  Gingerjub you gingerly rascal take that and run along with ye to the lockers and get something better  I hope I do no wrong Mr Starbuck  It is the captains ordersgrog for the harpooneer on a whale  Enough replied Starbuck only dont hit him again but  Oh I never hurt when I hit except when I hit a whale or something of that sort and this fellows a weazel  What were you about saying sir  Only this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyself  When Stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of teacaddy in the other  The first contained strong spirits and was handed to Queequeg the second was Aunt Charitys gift and that was freely given to the waves CHAPTER 73  Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale and Then Have a Talk Over HimIt must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whales prodigious head hanging to the Pequods side  But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it  For the present other matters press and the best we can do now for the head is to pray heaven the tackles may hold  Now during the past night and forenoon the Pequod had gradually drifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow brit gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near  And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day if opportunity offered  Nor was this long wanting  Tall spouts were seen to leeward and two boats Stubbs and Flasks were detached in pursuit  Pulling further and further away they at last became almost invisible to the men at the masthead  But suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast  An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale  So close did the monster come to the hull that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a maelstrom within three rods of the planks he wholly disappeared from view as if diving under the keel  Cut cut was the cry from the ship to the boats which for one instant seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessels side  But having plenty of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly they paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction and still plied their oars in another the contending strain threatened to take them under  But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain And they stuck to it till they did gain it when instantly a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel as the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose to view under her bows snapping and quivering and so flinging off its drippings that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water while the whale beyond also rose to sight and once more the boats were free to fly  But the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him so that they performed a complete circuit  Meantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till close flanking him on both sides Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whales body rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinking at every new gash as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock  At last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he turned upon his back a corpse  While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing some conversation ensued between them  I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard said Stubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan  Wants with it said Flask coiling some spare line in the boats bow did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whales head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a Right Whales on the larboard did you never hear Stubb that that ship can never afterwards capsize  Why not  I dont know but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so and he seems to know all about ships charms  But I sometimes think hell charm the ship to no good at last  I dont half like that chap Stubb  Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snakes head Stubb  Sink him  I never look at him at all but if ever I get a chance of a dark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one by look down there Flaskpointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both handsAye will I  Flask I take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise  Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship  Hes the devil I say  The reason why you dont see his tail is because he tucks it up out of sight he carries it coiled away in his pocket I guess  Blast him now that I think of it hes always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots  He sleeps in his boots dont he  He hasnt got any hammock but Ive seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging  No doubt and its because of his cursed tail he coils it down do ye see in the eye of the rigging  Whats the old man have so much to do with him for  Striking up a swap or a bargain I suppose  Bargainabout what  Why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that White Whale and the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then hell surrender Moby Dick  Pooh  Stubb you are skylarking how can Fedallah do that  I dont know Flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked one I tell ye  Why they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flagship once switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home  Well he was at home and asked the devil what he wanted  The devil switching his hoofs up and says I want John  What for says the old governor  What business is that of yours says the devil getting madI want to use him  Take him says the governorand by the Lord Flask if the devil didnt give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him Ill eat this whale in one mouthful  But look sharpaint you all ready there  Well then pull ahead and lets get the whale alongside  I think I remember some such story as you were telling said Flask when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship but I cant remember where  Three Spaniards  Adventures of those three bloodyminded soladoes Did ye read it there Flask  I guess ye did  No never saw such a book heard of it though  But now tell me Stubb do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now was the same you say is now on board the Pequod  Am I the same man that helped kill this whale  Doesnt the devil live for ever who ever heard that the devil was dead  Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil  And if the devil has a latchkey to get into the admirals cabin dont you suppose he can crawl into a porthole  Tell me that Mr Flask  How old do you suppose Fedallah is Stubb  Do you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well thats the figure one now take all the hoops in the Pequods hold and string along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that wouldnt begin to be Fedallahs age  Nor all the coopers in creation couldnt show hoops enough to make oughts enough  But see here Stubb I thought you a little boasted just now that you meant to give Fedallah a seatoss if you got a good chance Now if hes so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he is going to live for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboardtell me that  Give him a good ducking anyhow  But hed crawl back  Duck him again and keep ducking him  Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you thoughyes and drown youwhat then  I should like to see him try it Id give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldnt dare to show his face in the admirals cabin again for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he lives and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much Damn the devil Flask so you suppose Im afraid of the devil  Whos afraid of him except the old governor who daresnt catch him and put him in doubledarbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnapping people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil kidnapped hed roast for him  Theres a governor  Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab  Do I suppose it  Youll know it before long Flask  But I am going now to keep a sharp lookout on him and if I see anything very suspicious going on Ill just take him by the nape of his neck and sayLook here Beelzebub you dont do it and if he makes any fuss by the Lord Ill make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come short off at the stumpdo you see and then I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion hell sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs  And what will you do with the tail Stubb  Do with it  Sell it for an ox whip when we get homewhat else  Now do you mean what you say and have been saying all along Stubb  Mean or not mean here we are at the ship  The boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard side where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him  Didnt I tell you so said Flask yes youll soon see this right whales head hoisted up opposite that parmacettis  In good time Flasks saying proved true  As before the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whales head now by the counterpoise of both heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may well believe  So when on one side you hoist in Lockes head you go over that way but now on the other side hoist in Kants and you come back again but in very poor plight  Thus some minds for ever keep trimming boat  Oh ye foolish throw all these thunderheads overboard and then you will float light and right  In disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crownpiece  But nothing like this in the present case had been done  The carcases of both whales had dropped astern and the headladen ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers  Meantime Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whales head and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand  And Ahab chanced so to stand that the Parsee occupied his shadow while if the Parsees shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with and lengthen Ahabs  As the crew toiled on Laplandish speculations were bandied among them concerning all these passing things CHAPTER 74  The Sperm Whales HeadContrasted ViewHere now are two great whales laying their heads together let us join them and lay together our own  Of the grand order of folio leviathans the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the most noteworthy  They are the only whales regularly hunted by man  To the Nantucketer they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale  As the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequods side and as we may freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across the deckwhere I should like to know will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here  In the first place you are struck by the general contrast between these heads  Both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whales which the Right Whales sadly lacks  There is more character in the Sperm Whales head  As you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him in point of pervading dignity  In the present instance too this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit giving token of advanced age and large experience  In short he is what the fishermen technically call a greyheaded whale  Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these headsnamely the two most important organs the eye and the ear  Far back on the side of the head and low down near the angle of either whales jaw if you narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young colts eye so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head  Now from this peculiar sideway position of the whales eyes it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more than he can one exactly astern  In a word the position of the whales eyes corresponds to that of a mans ears and you may fancy for yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objects through your ears  You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight sideline of sight and about thirty more behind it  If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would not be able to see him any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind  In a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the same time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makes the front of a manwhat indeed but his eyes  Moreover while in most other animals that I can now think of the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position of the whales eyes effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys this of course must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts The whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him  Man may in effect be said to look out on the world from a sentrybox with two joined sashes for his window  But with the whale these two sashes are separately inserted making two distinct windows but sadly impairing the view  This peculiarity of the whales eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes  A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the Leviathan  But I must be content with a hint  So long as a mans eyes are open in the light the act of seeing is involuntary that is he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him  Nevertheless any ones experience will teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively and completely to examine any two thingshowever large or however smallat one and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other But if you now come to separate these two objects and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in order to see one of them in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness  How is it then with the whale  True both his eyes in themselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more comprehensive combining and subtle than mans that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects one on one side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction  If he can then is it as marvellous a thing in him as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid  Nor strictly investigated is there any incongruity in this comparison  It may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to queer frights so common to such whales I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them  But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye  If you are an entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two heads for hours and never discover that organ  The ear has no external leaf whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so wondrously minute is it  It is lodged a little behind the eye  With respect to their ears this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right  While the ear of the former has an external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without  Is it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hares  But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschels great telescope and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of hearing  Not at allWhy then do you try to enlarge your mind  Subtilize it  Let us now with whatever levers and steamengines we have at hand cant over the sperm whales head that it may lie bottom up then ascending by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach  But let us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are  What a really beautiful and chastelooking mouth from floor to ceiling lined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy as bridal satins  But come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuffbox with the hinge at one end instead of one side  If you pry it up so as to get it overhead and expose its rows of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis and such alas it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force  But far more terrible is it to behold when fathoms down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating there suspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen feet long hanging straight down at rightangles with his body for all the world like a ships jibboom  This whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of sorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a reproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lockjaws upon him  In most cases this lower jawbeing easily unhinged by a practised artistis disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles including canes umbrellastocks and handles to ridingwhips  With a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an anchor and when the proper time comessome few days after the other workQueequeg Daggoo and Tashtego being all accomplished dentists are set to drawing teeth  With a keen cuttingspade Queequeg lances the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle being rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands  There are generally fortytwo teeth in all in old whales much worn down but undecayed nor filled after our artificial fashion  The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs and piled away like joists for building houses CHAPTER 75  The Right Whales HeadContrasted ViewCrossing the deck let us now have a good long look at the Right Whales head  As in general shape the noble Sperm Whales head may be compared to a Roman warchariot especially in front where it is so broadly rounded so at a broad view the Right Whales head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliottoed shoe  Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemakers last  And in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably be lodged she and all her progeny  But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects according to your point of view  If you stand on its summit and look at these two Fshaped spoutholes you would take the whole head for an enormous bassviol and these spiracles the apertures in its soundingboard  Then again if you fix your eye upon this strange crested comblike incrustation on the top of the massthis green barnacled thing which the Greenlanders call the crown and the Southern fishers the bonnet of the Right Whale fixing your eyes solely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a birds nest in its crotch  At any rate when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy has been fixed by the technical term crown also bestowed upon it in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner  But if this whale be a king he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem  Look at that hanging lower lip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by carpenters measurement about twenty feet long and five feet deep a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more  A great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be harelipped The fissure is about a foot across  Probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast when earthquakes caused the beach to gape  Over this lip as over a slippery threshold we now slide into the mouth  Upon my word were I at Mackinaw I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam Good Lord is this the road that Jonah went  The roof is about twelve feet high and runs to a pretty sharp angle as if there were a regular ridgepole there while these ribbed arched hairy sides present us with those wondrous half vertical scimetarshaped slats of whalebone say three hundred on a side which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned  The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres through which the Right Whale strains the water and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time  In the central blinds of bone as they stand in their natural order there are certain curious marks curves hollows and ridges whereby some whalemen calculate the creatures age as the age of an oak by its circular rings  Though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable yet it has the savor of analogical probability  At any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable  In old times there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds  One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous whiskers inside of the whales mouth another hogs bristles a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper CHOP which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouthThis reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker or rather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw  Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenanceAs every one knows these same hogs bristles fins whiskers blinds or whatever you please furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances  But in this particular the demand has long been on the decline  It was in Queen Annes time that the bone was in its glory the farthingale being then all the fashion  And as those ancient dames moved about gaily though in the jaws of the whale as you may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone  But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment and standing in the Right Whales mouth look around you afresh  Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ and gazing upon its thousand pipes  For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkeythe tongue which is glued as it were to the floor of the mouth  It is very fat and tender and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck  This particular tongue now before us at a passing glance I should say it was a sixbarreler that is it will yield you about that amount of oil  Ere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started withthat the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads  To sum up then in the Right Whales there is no great well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a lower jaw like the Sperm Whales  Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone no huge lower lip and scarcely anything of a tongue  Again the Right Whale has two external spoutholes the Sperm Whale only one  Look your last now on these venerable hooded heads while they yet lie together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the other will not be very long in following  Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whales there  It is the same he died with only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away  I think his broad brow to be full of a prairielike placidity born of a speculative indifference as to death  But mark the other heads expression  See that amazing lower lip pressed by accident against the vessels side so as firmly to embrace the jaw  Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death  This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic the Sperm Whale a Platonian who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years CHAPTER 76  The BatteringRamEre quitting for the nonce the Sperm Whales head I would have you as a sensible physiologist simplyparticularly remark its front aspect in all its compacted collectedness  I would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever batteringram power may be lodged there  Here is a vital point for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling but not the less true events perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history  You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boomlike lower jaw you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head much in the same way indeed as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin  Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose and that what nose he hashis spout holeis on the top of his head you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head nearly one third of his entire length from the front  Wherefore you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whales head is a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever Furthermore you are now to consider that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part of the front of the head is there the slightest vestige of bone and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development  So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad  Finally though as will soon be revealed its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy  In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale as the rind wraps an orange  Just so with the head but with this difference about the head this envelope though not so thick is of a boneless toughness inestimable by any man who has not handled it  The severest pointed harpoon the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm impotently rebounds from it  It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses hoofs I do not think that any sensation lurks in it  Bethink yourself also of another thing  When two large loaded Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks what do the sailors do  They do not suspend between them at the point of coming contact any merely hard substance like iron or wood  No they hold there a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest and toughest of oxhide  That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crowbars  By itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at  But supplementary to this it has hypothetically occurred to me that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them capable at will of distension or contraction and as the Sperm Whale as far as I know has no such provision in him considering too the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope considering the unique interior of his head it has hypothetically occurred to me I say that those mystical lungcelled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction  If this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that might to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes  Now mark  Unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable wall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated as piled wood isby the cord and all obedient to one volition as the smallest insect  So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats I trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific you would not elevate one hair of your eyebrow  For unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth  But clear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter how small the chances for the provincials then  What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddesss veil at Lais CHAPTER 77  The Great Heidelburgh TunNow comes the Baling of the Case  But to comprehend it aright you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon  Regarding the Sperm Whales head as a solid oblong you may on an inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the lower is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale  At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two almost equal parts which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substanceQuoin is not a Euclidean term  It belongs to the pure nautical mathematics  I know not that it has been defined before  A quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both sidesThe lower subdivided part called the junk is one immense honeycomb of oil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousand infiltrated cells of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent  The upper part known as the Case may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale  And as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front so the whales vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun  Moreover as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages namely the highlyprized spermaceti in its absolutely pure limpid and odoriferous state Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature  Though in life it remains perfectly fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death it soon begins to concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water  A large whales case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm though from unavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks and dribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can  I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated within but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearlcoloured membrane like the lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whales case  It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head and sinceas has been elsewhere set forththe head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale you have more than twentysix feet for the depth of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ships side  As in decapitating the whale the operators instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine he has therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents  It is this decapitated end of the head also which is at last elevated out of the water and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles whose hempen combinations on one side make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter  Thus much being said attend now I pray you to that marvellous andin this particular instancealmost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whales great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped CHAPTER 78  Cistern and BucketsNimble as a cat Tashtego mounts aloft and without altering his erect posture runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyardarm to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun  He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip consisting of only two parts travelling through a singlesheaved block  Securing this block so that it hangs down from the yardarm he swings one end of the rope till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck Then handoverhand down the other part the Indian drops through the air till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head Therestill high elevated above the rest of the company to whom he vivaciously crieshe seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower  A shorthandled sharp spade being sent up to him he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun  In this business he proceeds very heedfully like a treasurehunter in some old house sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in  By the time this cautious search is over a stout ironbound bucket precisely like a wellbucket has been attached to one end of the whip while the other end being stretched across the deck is there held by two or three alert hands  These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian to whom another person has reached up a very long pole Inserting this pole into the bucket Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun till it entirely disappears then giving the word to the seamen at the whip up comes the bucket again all bubbling like a dairymaids pail of new milk  Carefully lowered from its height the fullfreighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quickly emptied into a large tub  Then remounting aloft it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more  Towards the end Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder and deeper and deeper into the Tun until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down  Now the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all at once a queer accident happened  Whether it was that Tashtego that wild Indian was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his onehanded hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so without stating his particular reasons how it was exactly there is no telling now but on a sudden as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly upmy God poor Tashtegolike the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well dropped headforemost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling went clean out of sight  Man overboard cried Daggoo who amid the general consternation first came to his senses  Swing the bucket this way and putting one foot into it so as the better to secure his slippery handhold on the whip itself the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom Meantime there was a terrible tumult  Looking over the side they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea as if that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk  At this instant while Daggoo on the summit of the head was clearing the whipwhich had somehow got foul of the great cutting tacklesa sharp cracking noise was heard and to the unspeakable horror of all one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg  The one remaining hook upon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head  Come down come down yelled the seamen to Daggoo but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head should drop he would still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out  In heavens name man cried Stubb are you ramming home a cartridge thereAvast  How will that help him jamming that ironbound bucket on top of his head  Avast will ye  Stand clear of the tackle cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket  Almost in the same instant with a thunderboom the enormous mass dropped into the sea like Niagaras TableRock into the whirlpool the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glittering copper and all caught their breath as half swingingnow over the sailors heads and now over the waterDaggoo through a thick mist of spray was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles while poor buriedalive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea  But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away when a naked figure with a boardingsword in his hand was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks  The next a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue  One packed rush was made to the side and every eye counted every ripple as moment followed moment and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen  Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little off from the ship  Ha ha cried Daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perch overhead and looking further off from the side we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave  Both bothit is bothcried Daggoo again with a joyful shout and soon after Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian  Drawn into the waiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but Tashtego was long in coming to and Queequeg did not look very brisk  Now how had this noble rescue been accomplished  Why diving after the slowly descending head Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then dropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards and so hauled out poor Tash by the head  He averred that upon first thrusting in for him a leg was presented but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be and might occasion great troublehe had thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought a somerset upon the Indian so that with the next trial he came forth in the good old wayhead foremost  As for the great head itself that was doing as well as could be expected  And thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of Tashtego was successfully accomplished in the teeth too of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten  Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing riding and rowing  I know that this queer adventure of the GayHeaders will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some ones falling into a cistern ashore an accident which not seldom happens and with much less reason too than the Indians considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whales well  But peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this  We thought the tissued infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale was the lightest and most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself  We have thee there  Not at all but I have ye for at the time poor Tash fell in the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the wella double welded hammered substance as I have before said much heavier than the sea water and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost  But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run as you may say  Yes it was a running delivery so it was  Now had Tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious perishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale  Only one sweeter end can readily be recalledthe delicious death of an Ohio honeyhunter who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree found such exceeding store of it that leaning too far over it sucked him in so that he died embalmed  How many think ye have likewise fallen into Platos honey head and sweetly perished there CHAPTER 79  The PrairieTo scan the lines of his face or feel the bumps on the head of this Leviathan this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken  Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon  Still in that famous work of his Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men but also attentively studies the faces of horses birds serpents and fish and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein  Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man Therefore though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of these two semisciences to the whale I will do my endeavor  I try all things I achieve what I can  Physiognomically regarded the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature He has no proper nose  And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression hence it would seem that its entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect the countenance of the whale  For as in landscape gardening a spire cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated openwork belfry of the nose  Dash the nose from Phidiass marble Jove and what a sorry remainder  Nevertheless Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his proportions are so stately that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all  Nay it is an added grandeur  A nose to the whale would have been impertinent  As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jollyboat your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled  A pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne  In some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the Sperm Whale is that of the full front of his head This aspect is sublime  In thought a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the morning  In the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it  Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles the elephants brow is majestic  Human or animal the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to their decrees  It signifiesGod done this day by my hand  But in most creatures nay in man himself very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeares or Melancthons rise so high and descend so low that the eyes themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lakes and all above them in the foreheads wrinkles you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer But in the great Sperm Whale this high and mighty godlike dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature  For you see no one point precisely not one distinct feature is revealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no face he has none proper nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead pleated with riddles dumbly lowering with the doom of boats and ships and men  Nor in profile does this wondrous brow diminish though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so  In profile you plainly perceive that horizontal semicrescentic depression in the foreheads middle which in man is Lavaters mark of genius  But how  Genius in the Sperm Whale  Has the Sperm Whale ever written a book spoken a speech  No his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it  It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence  And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World he would have been deified by their childmagian thoughts  They deified the crocodile of the Nile because the crocodile is tongueless and the Sperm Whale has no tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small as to be incapable of protrusion  If hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to their birthright the merry Mayday gods of old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to Joves high seat the great Sperm Whale shall lord it  Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics  But there is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every mans and every beings face  Physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing fable  If then Sir William Jones who read in thirty languages could not read the simplest peasants face in its profounder and more subtle meanings how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whales brow  I but put that brow before you  Read it if you can CHAPTER 80  The NutIf the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square  In the fullgrown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length  Unhinge the lower jaw and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base  But in lifeas we have elsewhere seenthis inclined plane is angularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm  At the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this craterin another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depthreposes the mere handful of this monsters brain  The brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden away behind its vast outworks like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec  So like a choice casket is it secreted in him that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubicyards of his sperm magazine  Lying in strange folds courses and convolutions to their apprehensions it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence  It is plain then that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan in the creatures living intact state is an entire delusion  As for his true brain you can then see no indications of it nor feel any The whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the common world  If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from the same point of view  Indeed place this reversed skull scaled down to the human magnitude among a plate of mens skulls and you would involuntarily confound it with them and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit in phrenological phrase you would sayThis man had no selfesteem and no veneration  And by those negations considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is  But if from the comparative dimensions of the whales proper brain you deem it incapable of being adequately charted then I have another idea for you  If you attentively regard almost any quadrupeds spine you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper  It is a German conceit that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls  But the curious external resemblance I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive  A foreign friend once pointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying in a sort of bassorelievo the beaked prow of his canoe  Now I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal  For I believe that much of a mans character will be found betokened in his backbone  I would rather feel your spine than your skull whoever you are  A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul  I rejoice in my spine as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world  Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale  His cranial cavity is continuous with the first neckvertebra and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across being eight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards  As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity  Now of course this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substancethe spinal cordas the brain and directly communicates with the brain  And what is still more for many feet after emerging from the brains cavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost equal to that of the brain Under all these circumstances would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whales spine phrenologically  For viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord  But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the Sperm Whales hump  This august hump if I mistake not rises over one of the larger vertebrae and is therefore in some sort the outer convex mould of it  From its relative situation then I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale  And that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to know CHAPTER 81  The Pequod Meets The VirginThe predestinated day arrived and we duly met the ship Jungfrau Derick De Deer master of Bremen  At one time the greatest whaling people in the world the Dutch and Germans are now among the least but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific  For some reason the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects While yet some distance from the Pequod she rounded to and dropping a boat her captain was impelled towards us impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern  What has he in his hand there cried Starbuck pointing to something wavingly held by the German  Impossiblea lampfeeder  Not that said Stubb no no its a coffeepot Mr Starbuck hes coming off to make us our coffee is the Yarman dont you see that big tin can there alongside of himthats his boiling water Oh hes all right is the Yarman  Go along with you cried Flask its a lampfeeder and an oilcan Hes out of oil and has come abegging  However curious it may seem for an oilship to be borrowing oil on the whaleground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lampfeeder as Flask did declare  As he mounted the deck Ahab abruptly accosted him without at all heeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale immediately turning the conversation to his lampfeeder and oil can with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darknesshis last drop of Bremen oil being gone and not a single flyingfish yet captured to supply the deficiency concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a CLEAN one that is an empty one well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin  His necessities supplied Derick departed but he had not gained his ships side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mastheads of both vessels and so eager for the chase was Derick that without pausing to put his oilcan and lampfeeder aboard he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lampfeeders  Now the game having risen to leeward he and the other three German boats that soon followed him had considerably the start of the Pequods keels  There were eight whales an average pod  Aware of their danger they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness  They left a great wide wake as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea  Full in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him seemed afflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity  Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social Nevertheless he stuck to their wake though indeed their back water must have retarded him because the whitebone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet  His spout was short slow and laborious coming forth with a choking sort of gush and spending itself in torn shreds followed by strange subterranean commotions in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity causing the waters behind him to upbubble  Whos got some paregoric said Stubb he has the stomachache Im afraid  Lord think of having half an acre of stomachache  Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him boys  Its the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before it must be hes lost his tiller  As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows on her way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous ribends expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin  Whether he had lost that fin in battle or had been born without it it were hard to say  Only wait a bit old chap and Ill give ye a sling for that wounded arm cried cruel Flask pointing to the whaleline near him  Mind he dont sling thee with it cried Starbuck  Give way or the German will have him  With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish because not only was he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales were going with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit for the time  At this juncture the Pequods keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered but from the great start he had had Dericks boat still led the chase though every moment neared by his foreign rivals  The only thing they feared was that from being already so nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him  As for Derick he seemed quite confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lampfeeder at the other boats  The ungracious and ungrateful dog cried Starbuck he mocks and dares me with the very poorbox I filled for him not five minutes agothen in his old intense whisperGive way greyhounds  Dog to it  I tell ye what it is mencried Stubb to his crewits against my religion to get mad but Id like to eat that villainous YarmanPullwont ye  Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye  Do ye love brandy  A hogshead of brandy then to the best man  Come why dont some of ye burst a bloodvessel  Whos that been dropping an anchor overboardwe dont budge an inchwere becalmed  Halloo heres grass growing in the boats bottomand by the Lord the mast theres budding  This wont do boys  Look at that Yarman  The short and long of it is men will ye spit fire or not  Oh see the suds he makes cried Flask dancing up and downWhat a humpOh DO pile on the beeflays like a log  Oh my lads DO springslapjacks and quahogs for supper you know my ladsbaked clams and muffinsoh DO DO springhes a hundred barrellerdont lose him nowdont oh DONTsee that YarmanOh wont ye pull for your duff my ladssuch a sog such a sogger Dont ye love sperm  There goes three thousand dollars mena banka whole bank  The bank of EnglandOh DO DO DOWhats that Yarman about now  At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lampfeeder at the advancing boats and also his oilcan perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals way and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss  The unmannerly Dutch dogger cried Stubb  Pull now men like fifty thousand lineofbattleship loads of redhaired devils  What dye say Tashtego are you the man to snap your spine in twoandtwenty pieces for the honour of old Gayhead  What dye say  I say pull like goddamcried the Indian  Fiercely but evenly incited by the taunts of the German the Pequods three boats now began ranging almost abreast and so disposed momentarily neared him  In that fine loose chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey the three mates stood up proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of There she slides now  Hurrah for the whiteash breeze  Down with the Yarman  Sail over him  But so decided an original start had Derick had that spite of all their gallantry he would have proved the victor in this race had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman  While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his whiteash and while in consequence Dericks boat was nigh to capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty ragethat was a good time for Starbuck Stubb and Flask With a shout they took a mortal start forwards and slantingly ranged up on the Germans quarter  An instant more and all four boats were diagonically in the whales immediate wake while stretching from them on both sides was the foaming swell that he made  It was a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight  The whale was now going head out and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright  Now to this hand now to that he yawed in his faltering flight and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodically sank in the sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin  So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks  But the bird has a voice and with plaintive cries will make known her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea was chained up and enchanted in him he had no voice save that choking respiration through his spiracle and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable while still in his amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied  Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequods boats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart ere the last chance would for ever escape  But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tigersQueequeg Tashtego Daggooinstinctively sprang to their feet and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed their barbs and darted over the head of the German harpooneer their three Nantucket irons entered the whale  Blinding vapours of foam and whitefire  The three boats in the first fury of the whales headlong rush bumped the Germans aside with such force that both Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three flying keels  Dont be afraid my butterboxes cried Stubb casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by yell be picked up presentlyall rightI saw some sharks asternSt Bernards dogs you knowrelieve distressed travellers  Hurrah this is the way to sail now  Every keel a sunbeam  HurrahHere we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar  This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plainmakes the wheelspokes fly boys when you fasten to him that way and theres danger of being pitched out too when you strike a hill  Hurrah this is the way a fellow feels when hes going to Davy Jonesall a rush down an endless inclined plane  Hurrah this whale carries the everlasting mail  But the monsters run was a brief one  Giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded  With a grating rush the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous might they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till at lastowing to the perpendicular strain from the leadlined chocks of the boats whence the three ropes went straight down into the bluethe gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water while the three sterns tilted high in the air  And the whale soon ceasing to sound for some time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more line though the position was a little ticklish  But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on as it is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes  Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken whale stays under water the more he is exhausted  Because owing to the enormous surface of himin a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feetthe pressure of the water is immense  We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even here aboveground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres  One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty lineofbattle ships with all their guns and stores and men on board  As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down into its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and placidity the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony  Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows  Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock  Suspended and to what  To three bits of board Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly saidCanst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fishspears The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as straw the arrow cannot make him flee darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear  This the creature this he  Oh that unfulfilments should follow the prophets  For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea to hide him from the Pequods fishspears  In that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half Xerxes army  Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head  Stand by men he stirs cried Starbuck as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them as by magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every oarsman felt them in his seat  The next moment relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea  Haul in  Haul in cried Starbuck again hes rising  The lines of which hardly an instant before not one hands breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within two ships lengths of the hunters  His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion  In most land animals there are certain valves or floodgates in many of their veins whereby when wounded the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions  Not so with the whale one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire nonvalvular structure of the bloodvessels so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams  Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distant and numerous its interior fountains that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period even as in a drought a river will flow whose source is in the wellsprings of faroff and undiscernible hills Even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into him they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept continually playing while the natural spouthole in his head was only at intervals however rapid sending its affrighted moisture into the air  From this last vent no blood yet came because no vital part of him had thus far been struck  His life as they significantly call it was untouched  As the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of his form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainly revealed  His eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were beheld  As strange misgrown masses gather in the knotholes of the noblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whales eyes had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see  But pity there was none  For all his old age and his one arm and his blind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in order to light the gay bridals and other merrymakings of men and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all  Still rolling in his blood at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the flank  A nice spot cried Flask just let me prick him there once  Avast cried Starbuck theres no need of that  But humane Starbuck was too late  At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore capsizing Flasks boat and marring the bows  It was his death stroke  For by this time so spent was he by loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up the white secrets of his belly lay like a log and died  It was most piteous that last expiring spout  As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with halfstifled melancholy gurglings the spraycolumn lowers and lowers to the groundso the last long dying spout of the whale  Soon while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled Immediately by Starbucks orders lines were secured to it at different points so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords  By very heedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale was transferred to her side and was strongly secured there by the stiffest flukechains for it was plain that unless artificially upheld the body would at once sink to the bottom  It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh on the lower part of the bunch before described  But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to  But still more curious was the fact of a lancehead of stone being found in him not far from the buried iron the flesh perfectly firm about it  Who had darted that stone lance  And when  It might have been darted by some Nor West Indian long before America was discovered  What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling  But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries by the ships being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea owing to the bodys immensely increasing tendency to sink  However Starbuck who had the ordering of affairs hung on to it to the last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at length the ship would have been capsized if still persisting in locking arms with the body then when the command was given to break clear from it such was the immovable strain upon the timberheads to which the flukechains and cables were fastened that it was impossible to cast them off  Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant  To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house  The ship groaned and gasped  Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places by the unnatural dislocation  In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable flukechains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over  Hold on hold on wont ye cried Stubb to the body dont be in such a devil of a hurry to sink  By thunder men we must do something or go for it  No use prying there avast I say with your handspikes and run one of ye for a prayer book and a penknife and cut the big chains  Knife  Aye aye cried Queequeg and seizing the carpenters heavy hatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing at the largest flukechains  But a few strokes full of sparks were given when the exceeding strain effected the rest With a terrific snap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank  Now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it  Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface  If the only whales that thus sank were old meagre and brokenhearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him  But it is not so  For young whales in the highest health and swelling with noble aspirations prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life with all their panting lard about them even these brawny buoyant heroes do sometimes sink  Be it said however that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species  Where one of that sort go down twenty Right Whales do  This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free  But there are instances where after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whale again rises more buoyant than in life  But the reason of this is obvious  Gases are generated in him he swells to a prodigious magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon  A lineofbattle ship could hardly keep him under then  In the Shore Whaling on soundings among the Bays of New Zealand when a Right Whale gives token of sinking they fasten buoys to him with plenty of rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again  It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the Pequods mastheads announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats though the only spout in sight was that of a FinBack belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because of its incredible power of swimming  Nevertheless the FinBacks spout is so similar to the Sperm Whales that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it  And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute  The Virgin crowding all sail made after her four young keels and thus they all disappeared far to leeward still in bold hopeful chase  Oh many are the FinBacks and many are the Dericks my friend CHAPTER 82  The Honour and Glory of WhalingThere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method  The more I dive into this matter of whaling and push my researches up to the very springhead of it so much the more am I impressed with its great honourableness and antiquity and especially when I find so many great demigods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way or other have shed distinction upon it I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a fraternity  The gallant Perseus a son of Jupiter was the first whaleman and to the eternal honour of our calling be it said that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent Those were the knightly days of our profession when we only bore arms to succor the distressed and not to fill mens lampfeeders Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda how the lovely Andromeda the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on the seacoast and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off Perseus the prince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and delivered and married the maid  It was an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart  And let no man doubt this Arkite story for in the ancient Joppa now Jaffa on the Syrian coast in one of the Pagan temples there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale which the citys legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew  When the Romans took Joppa the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph  What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story is this it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail  Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromedaindeed by some supposed to be indirectly derived from itis that famous story of St George and the Dragon which dragon I maintain to have been a whale for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together and often stand for each other  Thou art as a lion of the waters and as a dragon of the sea saith Ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in truth some versions of the Bible use that word itself  Besides it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep Any man may kill a snake but only a Perseus a St George a Coffin have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale  Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffinlike shape and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignorance of those times when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists and considering that as in Perseus case St Georges whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animal ridden by St George might have been only a large seal or seahorse bearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene to hold this socalled dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself  In fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole story will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the Philistines Dagon by name who being planted before the ark of Israel his horses head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him and only the stump or fishy part of him remained  Thus then one of our own noble stamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of England and by good rights we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St George  And therefore let not the knights of that honourable company none of whom I venture to say have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St Georges decoration than they  Whether to admit Hercules among us or not concerning this I long remained dubious for though according to the Greek mythologies that antique Crockett and Kit Carsonthat brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him that might be mooted  It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unless indeed from the inside  Nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale  I claim him for one of our clan  But by the best contradictory authorities this Grecian story of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale and vice versa certainly they are very similar  If I claim the demigod then why not the prophet  Nor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order  Our grand master is still to be named for like royal kings of old times we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves  That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster which gives us the dread Vishnoo one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our LordVishnoo who by the first of his ten earthly incarnations has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale  When Brahma or the God of Gods saith the Shaster resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions he gave birth to Vishnoo to preside over the work but the Vedas or mystical books whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning the creation and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects these Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths rescued the sacred volumes  Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman then even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman  Perseus St George Hercules Jonah and Vishnoo theres a memberroll for you  What club but the whalemans can head off like that CHAPTER 83  Jonah Historically RegardedReference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter  Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale  But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans who standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale and Arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts for all that  One old SagHarbor whalemans chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was thisHe had one of those quaint oldfashioned Bibles embellished with curious unscientific plates one of which represented Jonahs whale with two spouts in his heada peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan the Right Whale and the varieties of that order concerning which the fishermen have this saying A penny roll would choke him his swallow is so very small  But to this Bishop Jebbs anticipative answer is ready  It is not necessary hints the Bishop that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whales belly but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth  And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop  For truly the Right Whales mouth would accommodate a couple of whisttables and comfortably seat all the players  Possibly too Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thoughts the Right Whale is toothless  Another reason which SagHarbor he went by that name urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whales gastric juices But this objection likewise falls to the ground because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a DEAD whaleeven as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents and crawled into them Besides it has been divined by other continental commentators that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a figurehead and I would add possibly called The Whale as some craft are nowadays christened the Shark the Gull the Eagle  Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a lifepreserveran inflated bag of windwhich the endangered prophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom  Poor SagHarbor therefore seems worsted all round  But he had still another reason for his want of faith  It was this if I remember right Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days journey of Nineveh a city on the Tigris very much more than three days journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast  How is that  But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of Nineveh  Yes  He might have carried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope  But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days not to speak of the Tigris waters near the site of Nineveh being too shallow for any whale to swim in  Besides this idea of Jonahs weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz its reputed discoverer and so make modern history a liar  But all these foolish arguments of old SagHarbor only evinced his foolish pride of reasona thing still more reprehensible in him seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea  I say it only shows his foolish impious pride and abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy  For by a Portuguese Catholic priest this very idea of Jonahs going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle  And so it was Besides to this day the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah  And some three centuries ago an English traveller in old Harriss Voyages speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honour of Jonah in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil CHAPTER 84  PitchpolingTo make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages are anointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom  Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage considering that oil and water are hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely  Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared took more than customary pains in that occupation crawling under its bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the crafts bald keel  He seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment  Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event  Towards noon whales were raised but so soon as the ship sailed down to them they turned and fled with swift precipitancy a disordered flight as of Cleopatras barges from Actium  Nevertheless the boats pursued and Stubbs was foremost  By great exertion Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the stricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal flight with added fleetness  Such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it  It became imperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him  But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible he swam so fast and furious  What then remained  Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand and countless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling  Small sword or broad sword in all its exercises boasts nothing like it  It is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme headway  Steel and wood included the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon and also of a lighter materialpine  It is furnished with a small rope called a warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting  But before going further it is important to mention here that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks  As a general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before any pitchpoling comes into play  Look now at Stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling  Look at him he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty feet ahead  Handling the long lance lightly glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secure its free end in his grasp leaving the rest unobstructed Then holding the lance full before his waistbands middle he levels it at the whale when covering him with it he steadily depresses the buttend in his hand thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm fifteen feet in the air  He minds you somewhat of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chin Next moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance and quivers in the life spot of the whale  Instead of sparkling water he now spouts red blood  That drove the spigot out of him cried Stubb  Tis Julys immortal Fourth all fountains must run wine today  Would now it were old Orleans whiskey or old Ohio or unspeakable old Monongahela  Then Tashtego lad Id have ye hold a canakin to the jet and wed drink round it  Yea verily hearts alive wed brew choice punch in the spread of his spouthole there and from that live punchbowl quaff the living stuff  Again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash  The agonized whale goes into his flurry the towline is slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern folds his hands and mutely watches the monster die CHAPTER 85  The FountainThat for six thousand yearsand no one knows how many millions of ages beforethe great whales should have been spouting all over the sea and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots and that for some centuries back thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale watching these sprinklings and spoutingsthat all this should be and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter minutes past one oclock PM of this sixteenth day of December AD 1851 it should still remain a problem whether these spoutings are after all really water or nothing but vapourthis is surely a noteworthy thing  Let us then look at this matter along with some interesting items contingent  Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim hence a herring or a cod might live a century and never once raise its head above the surface  But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs like a human beings the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere  Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world  But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude the Sperm Whales mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface and what is still more his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth  No he breathes through his spiracle alone and this is on the top of his head  If I say that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle I do not think I shall err though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words  Assume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time  That is to say he would then live without breathing  Anomalous as it may seem this is precisely the case with the whale who systematically lives by intervals his full hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he has no gills  How is this  Between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicellilike vessels which vessels when he quits the surface are completely distended with oxygenated blood  So that for an hour or more a thousand fathoms in the sea he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs  The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more cogent to me when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT as the fishermen phrase it  This is what I mean  If unmolested upon rising to the surface the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings  Say he stays eleven minutes and jets seventy times that is respires seventy breaths then whenever he rises again he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again to a minute  Now if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him so that he sounds he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air  And not till those seventy breaths are told will he finally go down to stay out his full term below Remark however that in different individuals these rates are different but in any one they are alike  Now why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air ere descending for good  How obvious is it too that this necessity for the whales rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase  For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight  Not so much thy skill then O hunter as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee  In man breathing is incessantly going onone breath only serving for two or three pulsations so that whatever other business he has to attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time  It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spouthole if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spouthole and being so clogged with two elements it could not be expected to have the power of smelling  But owing to the mystery of the spoutwhether it be water or whether it be vapourno absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head  Sure it is nevertheless that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories  But what does he want of them  No roses no violets no Colognewater in the sea  Furthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal and as that long canallike the grand Erie Canalis furnished with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has no voice unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles he talks through his nose  But then again what has the whale to say  Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this world unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living  Oh happy that the world is such an excellent listener  Now the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along horizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little to one side this curious canal is very much like a gaspipe laid down in a city on one side of a street  But the question returns whether this gaspipe is also a waterpipe in other words whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and discharged through the spiracle  It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle  Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be when in feeding he accidentally takes in water But the Sperm Whales food is far beneath the surface and there he cannot spout even if he would  Besides if you regard him very closely and time him with your watch you will find that when unmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration  But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject  Speak out  You have seen him spout then declare what the spout is can you not tell water from air  My dear sir in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things  I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all  And as for this whale spout you might almost stand in it and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely  The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it when always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading all around him  And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapour or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spouthole fissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whales head  For even when tranquilly swimming through the midday sea in a calm with his elevated hump sundried as a dromedarys in the desert even then the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain  Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout  It will not do for him to be peering into it and putting his face in it  You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it and bring it away  For even when coming into slight contact with the outer vapoury shreds of the jet which will often happen your skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of the thing so touching it  And I know one who coming into still closer contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view or otherwise I cannot say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm  Wherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to evade it  Another thing I have heard it said and I do not much doubt it that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes it will blind you  The wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me is to let this deadly spout alone  Still we can hypothesize even if we cannot prove and establish  My hypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist  And besides other reasons to this conclusion I am impelled by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale I account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other whales sometimes are  He is both ponderous and profound And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings such as Plato Pyrrho the Devil Jupiter Dante and so on there always goes up a certain semivisible steam while in the act of thinking deep thoughts  While composing a little treatise on Eternity I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflected there a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head  The invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep thought after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an August noon this seems an additional argument for the above supposition  And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour engendered by his incommunicable contemplations and that vapouras you will sometimes see itglorified by a rainbow as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts  For dye see rainbows do not visit the clear air they only irradiate vapour  And so through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind divine intuitions now and then shoot enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray  And for this I thank God for all have doubts many deny but doubts or denials few along with them have intuitions  Doubts of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly this combination makes neither believer nor infidel but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye CHAPTER 86  The TailOther poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less celestial I celebrate a tail  Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whales tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man it comprises upon its upper surface alone an area of at least fifty square feet  The compact round body of its root expands into two broad firm flat palms or flukes gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness  At the crotch or junction these flukes slightly overlap then sideways recede from each other like wings leaving a wide vacancy between  In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes  At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across  The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews but cut into it and you find that three distinct strata compose itupper middle and lower  The fibres in the upper and lower layers are long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and running crosswise between the outside layers  This triune structure as much as anything else imparts power to the tail  To the student of old Roman walls the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry  But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes insensibly blend with them and largely contribute to their might so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point  Could annihilation occur to matter this were the thing to do it  Nor does thisits amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions where infantileness of ease undulates through a Titanism of power  On the contrary those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it  Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony but it often bestows it and in everything imposingly beautiful strength has much to do with the magic  Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules and its charm would be gone  As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch  When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form mark what robustness is there  And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the Son the soft curled hermaphroditical Italian pictures in which his idea has been most successfully embodied these pictures so destitute as they are of all brawniness hint nothing of any power but the mere negative feminine one of submission and endurance which on all hands it is conceded form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings  Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of that whether wielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the mood it be in its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace Therein no fairys arm can transcend it  Five great motions are peculiar to it  First when used as a fin for progression Second when used as a mace in battle Third in sweeping Fourth in lobtailing Fifth in peaking flukes  First Being horizontal in its position the Leviathans tail acts in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures  It never wriggles  In man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority To the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion  Scrollwise coiled forwards beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it is this which gives that singular darting leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming  His sidefins only serve to steer by  Second It is a little significant that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in his conflicts with man he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail In striking at a boat he swiftly curves away his flukes from it and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil  If it be made in the unobstructed air especially if it descend to its mark the stroke is then simply irresistible  No ribs of man or boat can withstand it Your only salvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through the opposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat and the elasticity of its materials a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally the most serious result  These submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery that they are accounted mere childs play  Some one strips off a frock and the hole is stopped  Third I cannot demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephants trunk  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea and if he feel but a sailors whisker woe to that sailor whiskers and all  What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch  Had this tail any prehensile power I should straightway bethink me of Darmonodes elephant that so frequented the flowermarket and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels and then caressed their zones  On more accounts than one a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail for I have heard of yet another elephant that when wounded in the fight curved round his trunk and extracted the dart  Fourth Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity and kittenlike he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth  But still you see his power in his play  The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air then smiting the surface the thunderous concussion resounds for miles  You would almost think a great gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think that that was the smoke from the touchhole  Fifth As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface but when he is about to plunge into the deeps his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating a moment till they downwards shoot out of view  Excepting the sublime BREACHsomewhere else to be describedthis peaking of the whales flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature  Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven  So in dreams have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell  But in gazing at such scenes it is all in all what mood you are in if in the Dantean the devils will occur to you if in that of Isaiah the archangels  Standing at the masthead of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea I once saw a large herd of whales in the east all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes  As it seemed to me at the time such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld even in Persia the home of the fire worshippers As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant I then testified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout of all beings  For according to King Juba the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence  The chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the elephant so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality much less the creatures to which they respectively belong  For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan so compared with Leviathans tail his trunk is but the stalk of a lily  The most direful blow from the elephants trunk were as the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whales ponderous flukes which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air very much as an Indian juggler tosses his ballsThough all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant nevertheless there are not wanting some points of curious similitude among these is the spout  It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk and then elevating it jet it forth in a streamThe more I consider this mighty tail the more do I deplore my inability to express it  At times there are gestures in it which though they would well grace the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable  In an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are these mystic gestures that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to FreeMason signs and symbols that the whale indeed by these methods intelligently conversed with the world  Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body full of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant Dissect him how I may then I but go skin deep I know him not and never will  But if I know not even the tail of this whale how understand his head much more how comprehend his face when face he has none  Thou shalt see my back parts my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen  But I cannot completely make out his back parts and hint what he will about his face I say again he has no face CHAPTER 87  The Grand ArmadaThe long and narrow peninsula of Malacca extending southeastward from the territories of Birmah forms the most southerly point of all Asia  In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra Java Bally and Timor which with many others form a vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes  This rampart is pierced by several sallyports for the convenience of ships and whales conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca  By the straits of Sunda chiefly vessels bound to China from the west emerge into the China seas  Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands buttressed by that bold green promontory known to seamen as Java Head they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices and silks and jewels and gold and ivory with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched it seems a significant provision of nature that such treasures by the very formation of the land should at least bear the appearance however ineffectual of being guarded from the allgrasping western world  The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean the Baltic and the Propontis  Unlike the Danes these Orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered topsails from the endless procession of ships before the wind which for centuries past by night and by day have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east  But while they freely waive a ceremonial like this they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute  Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears  Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed yet even at the present day we occasionally hear of English and American vessels which in those waters have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged  With a fair fresh wind the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea and thence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm Whale sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands and gain the far coast of Japan in time for the great whaling season there  By these means the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific where Ahab though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick in the sea he was most known to frequent and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it  But how now in this zoned quest does Ahab touch no land does his crew drink air  Surely he will stop for water  Nay  For a long time now the circusrunning sun has raced within his fiery ring and needs no sustenance but whats in himself  So Ahab  Mark this too in the whaler  While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff to be transferred to foreign wharves the worldwandering whaleship carries no cargo but herself and crew their weapons and their wants  She has a whole lakes contents bottled in her ample hold  She is ballasted with utilities not altogether with unusable piglead and kentledge  She carries years water in her  Clear old prime Nantucket water which when three years afloat the Nantucketer in the Pacific prefers to drink before the brackish fluid but yesterday rafted off in casks from the Peruvian or Indian streams  Hence it is that while other ships may have gone to China from New York and back again touching at a score of ports the whaleship in all that interval may not have sighted one grain of soil her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves  So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come they would only answerWell boys heres the ark  Now as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda indeed as most of the ground roundabout was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising therefore as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head the lookouts were repeatedly hailed and admonished to keep wide awake  But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air yet not a single jet was descried  Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the straits when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us  But here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans the Sperm Whales instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies as in former times are now frequently met with in extensive herds sometimes embracing so great a multitude that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection  To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands  Broad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles and forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon a continuous chain of whalejets were upplaying and sparkling in the noonday air  Unlike the straight perpendicular twinjets of the Right Whale which dividing at top fall over in two branches like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forwardslanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually rising and falling away to leeward  Seen from the Pequods deck then as she would rise on a high hill of the sea this host of vapoury spouts individually curling up into the air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis descried of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height  As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains accelerate their march all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle and swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre  Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them the harpooneers handling their weapons and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats  If the wind only held little doubt had they that chased through these Straits of Sunda the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number  And who could tell whether in that congregated caravan Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshipped whiteelephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese  So with stunsail piled on stunsail we sailed along driving these leviathans before us when of a sudden the voice of Tashtego was heard loudly directing attention to something in our wake  Corresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in our rear  It seemed formed of detached white vapours rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales only they did not so completely come and go for they constantly hovered without finally disappearing  Levelling his glass at this sight Ahab quickly revolved in his pivothole crying Aloft there and rig whips and buckets to wet the sailsMalays sir and after us  As if too long lurking behind the headlands till the Pequod should fairly have entered the straits these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit to make up for their overcautious delay  But when the swift Pequod with a fresh leading wind was herself in hot chase how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuitmere ridingwhips and rowels to her that they were  As with glass under arm Ahab toandfro paced the deck in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him some such fancy as the above seemed his  And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance and beheld how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curseswhen all these conceits had passed through his brain Ahabs brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it without being able to drag the firm thing from its place  But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and when after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern the Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond then the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays  But still driving on in the wake of the whales at length they seemed abating their speed gradually the ship neared them and the wind now dying away word was passed to spring to the boats  But no sooner did the herd by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale become notified of the three keels that were after themthough as yet a mile in their rearthan they rallied again and forming in close ranks and battalions so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets moved on with redoubled velocity  Stripped to our shirts and drawers we sprang to the whiteash and after several hours pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution which when the fishermen perceive it in the whale they say he is gallied  The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now broken up in one measureless rout and like King Porus elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander they seemed going mad with consternation  In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles and aimlessly swimming hither and thither by their short thick spoutings they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic  This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number who completely paralysed as it were helplessly floated like waterlogged dismantled ships on the sea  Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures  Though banding together in tens of thousands the lionmaned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman  Witness too all human beings how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatres pit they will at the slightest alarm of fire rush helterskelter for the outlets crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to death Best therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men  Though many of the whales as has been said were in violent motion yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated but collectively remained in one place  As is customary in those cases the boats at once separated each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal  In about three minutes time Queequegs harpoon was flung the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces and then running away with us like light steered straight for the heart of the herd  Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances is in no wise unprecedented and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery  For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb  As blind and deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him as we thus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides menaced as we flew by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by iceisles in a tempest and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed  But not a bit daunted Queequeg steered us manfully now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance now edging away from that whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead while all the time Starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts for there was no time to make long ones  Nor were the oarsmen quite idle though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business  Out of the way Commodore cried one to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface and for an instant threatened to swamp us  Hard down with your tail there cried a second to another which close to our gunwale seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fanlike extremity  All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances originally invented by the Nantucket Indians called druggs  Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together so that they cross each others grain at right angles a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block and the other end of the line being looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used For then more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time  But sperm whales are not every day encountered while you may then you must kill all you can  And if you cannot kill them all at once you must wing them so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure  Hence it is that at times like these the drugg comes into requisition  Our boat was furnished with three of them  The first and second were successfully darted and we saw the whales staggeringly running off fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg  They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball  But upon flinging the third in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block it caught under one of the seats of the boat and in an instant tore it out and carried it away dropping the oarsman in the boats bottom as the seat slid from under him  On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in and so stopped the leaks for the time  It had been next to impossible to dart these druggedharpoons were it not that as we advanced into the herd our whales way greatly diminished moreover that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion the direful disorders seemed waning So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towing whale sideways vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake  Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales were heard but not felt  In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satinlike surface called a sleek produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods  Yes we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion  And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles and saw successive pods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multiplied spans of horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a Titanic circusrider might easily have overarched the middle ones and so have gone round on their backs  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us  We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up  Keeping at the centre of the lake we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves the women and children of this routed host  Now inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles the entire area at this juncture embraced by the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square miles  At any ratethough indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptivespoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon  I mention this circumstance because as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping or possibly being so young unsophisticated and every way innocent and inexperienced however it may have been these smaller whalesnow and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lakeevinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at  Like household dogs they came snuffling round us right up to our gunwales and touching them till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them Queequeg patted their foreheads Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance but fearful of the consequences for the time refrained from darting it  But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side  For suspended in those watery vaults floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers  The lake as I have hinted was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast as if leading two different lives at the time and while yet drawing mortal nourishment be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscenceeven so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us but not at us as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their newborn sight  Floating on their sides the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us  One of these little infants that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old might have measured some fourteen feet in length and some six feet in girth  He was a little frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final spring the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartars bow  The delicate sidefins and the palms of his flukes still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a babys ears newly arrived from foreign parts  Line line cried Queequeg looking over the gunwale him fast him fastWho line him  Who struckTwo whale one big one little  What ails ye man cried Starbuck  Looke here said Queequeg pointing down  As when the stricken whale that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope as after deep sounding he floats up again and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air so now Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam  Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase this natural line with the maternal end loose becomes entangled with the hempen one so that the cub is thereby trapped Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond  We saw young Leviathan amours in the deepThe sperm whale as with all other species of the Leviathan but unlike most other fish breeds indifferently at all seasons after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months producing but one at a time though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacoba contingency provided for in suckling by two teats curiously situated one on each side of the anus but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that  When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunters lance the mothers pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods  The milk is very sweet and rich it has been tasted by man it might do well with strawberries  When overflowing with mutual esteem the whales salute MORE HOMINUMAnd thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenely revelled in dalliance and delight  But even so amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy  Meanwhile as we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them  But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles was nothing to what at last met our eyes It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert to seek to hamstring him as it were by sundering or maiming his gigantic tailtendon  It is done by darting a shorthandled cuttingspade to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again  A whale wounded as we afterwards learned in this part but not effectually as it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying along with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of the wound he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold at the battle of Saratoga carrying dismay wherever he went  But agonizing as was the wound of this whale and an appalling spectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us  But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery this whale had become entangled in the harpoonline that he towed he had also run away with the cuttingspade in him and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoonline round his tail the cuttingspade itself had worked loose from his flesh  So that tormented to madness he was now churning through the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and tossing the keen spade about him wounding and murdering his own comrades  This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright  First the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if lifted by half spent billows from afar then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell the submarine bridalchambers and nurseries vanished in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters  Yes the long calm was departing  A low advancing hum was soon heard and then like to the tumultuous masses of blockice when the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain  Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places Starbuck taking the stern  Oars  Oars he intensely whispered seizing the helmgripe your oars and clutch your souls now  My God men stand by  Shove him off you Queequegthe whale thereprick himhit him  Stand upstand up and stay so  Spring menpull men never mind their backsscrape themscrape away  The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths  But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way rapidly and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet After many similar hairbreadth escapes we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles but now crossed by random whales all violently making for one centre  This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequegs hat who while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales had his hat taken clean from his head by the aireddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by  Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for having clumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness  Further pursuit was useless but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waifed  The waif is a pennoned pole two or three of which are carried by every boat and which when additional game is at hand are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both to mark its place on the sea and also as token of prior possession should the boats of any other ship draw near  The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the Fisherythe more whales the less fish  Of all the drugged whales only one was captured  The rest contrived to escape for the time but only to be taken as will hereafter be seen by some other craft than the Pequod CHAPTER 88  Schools and SchoolmastersThe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations  Now though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as must have been seen even at the present day small detached bands are occasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each  Such bands are known as schools  They generally are of two sorts those composed almost entirely of females and those mustering none but young vigorous males or bulls as they are familiarly designated  In cavalier attendance upon the school of females you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies  In truth this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman swimming about over the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem  The contrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking because while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions the ladies even at full growth are not more than onethird of the bulk of an averagesized male  They are comparatively delicate indeed I dare say not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist  Nevertheless it cannot be denied that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to EMBONPOINT  It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings  Like fashionables they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety  You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season having just returned perhaps from spending the summer in the Northern seas and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth  By the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year  When serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange suspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family  Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him and chases him away  High times indeed if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the Bashaw will he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of his bed for alas all fish bed in common  As ashore the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers just so with the whales who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love  They fence with their long lower jaws sometimes locking them together and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers  Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encountersfurrowed heads broken teeth scolloped fins and in some instances wrenched and dislocated mouths  But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harems lord then is it very diverting to watch that lord  Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines  Granting other whales to be in sight the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small  As for the sons and the daughters they beget why those sons and daughters must take care of themselves at least with only the maternal help  For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so being a great traveller he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world every baby an exotic  In good time nevertheless as the ardour of youth declines as years and dumps increase as reflection lends her solemn pauses in short as a general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens our Ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant admonitory stage of life forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old soul goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors  Now as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster  It is therefore not in strict character however admirably satirical that after going to school himself he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there but the folly of it  His title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale must have read the memoirs of Vidocq and informed himself what sort of a countryschoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils  The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years is true of all aged Sperm Whales  Almost universally a lone whaleas a solitary Leviathan is calledproves an ancient one  Like venerable mossbearded Daniel Boone he will have no one near him but Nature herself and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters and the best of wives she is though she keeps so many moody secrets  The schools composing none but young and vigorous males previously mentioned offer a strong contrast to the harem schools  For while those female whales are characteristically timid the young males or fortybarrelbulls as they call them are by far the most pugnacious of all Leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrous greyheaded grizzled whales sometimes met and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout  The Fortybarrelbull schools are larger than the harem schools Like a mob of young collegians they are full of fight fun and wickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard  They soon relinquish this turbulence though and when about threefourths grown break up and separately go about in quest of settlements that is harems  Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes  Say you strike a Fortybarrelbullpoor devil all his comrades quit him  But strike a member of the harem school and her companions swim around her with every token of concern sometimes lingering so near her and so long as themselves to fall a prey CHAPTER 89  FastFish and LooseFishThe allusion to the waif and waifpoles in the last chapter but one necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge  It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be finally killed and captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies all partaking of this one grand feature  For exampleafter a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line  Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen were there not some written or unwritten universal undisputed law applicable to all cases  Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment was that of Holland  It was decreed by the StatesGeneral in AD 1695  But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter  They have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinians Pandects and the Bylaws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other Peoples Business  Yes these laws might be engraven on a Queen Annes forthing or the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck so small are they  I  A FastFish belongs to the party fast to it  II  A LooseFish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it  But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it  First What is a FastFish  Alive or dead a fish is technically fast when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupantsa mast an oar a nineinch cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is all the same  Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif or any other recognised symbol of possession so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside as well as their intention so to do  These are scientific commentaries but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocksthe CokeuponLittleton of the fist  True among the more upright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party  But others are by no means so scrupulous  Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whaletrover litigated in England wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas and when indeed they the plaintiffs had succeeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril of their lives obliged to forsake not only their lines but their boat itself  Ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs  And when those defendants were remonstrated with their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs teeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done he would now retain their line harpoons and boat which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure  Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale line harpoons and boat  Mr Erskine was counsel for the defendants Lord Ellenborough was the judge  In the course of the defence the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con case wherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wifes viciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but in the course of years repenting of that step he instituted an action to recover possession of her  Erskine was on the other side and he then supported it by saying that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandoned her yet abandon her he did so that she became a loosefish and therefore when a subsequent gentleman reharpooned her the lady then became that subsequent gentlemans property along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her  Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other  These pleadings and the counter pleadings being duly heard the very learned Judge in set terms decided to witThat as for the boat he awarded it to the plaintiffs because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives but that with regard to the controverted whale harpoons and line they belonged to the defendants the whale because it was a LooseFish at the time of the final capture and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them it the fish acquired a property in those articles and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them Now the defendants afterwards took the fish ergo the aforesaid articles were theirs  A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge might possibly object to it  But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case these two laws touching FastFish and LooseFish I say will on reflection be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture the Temple of the Law like the Temple of the Philistines has but two props to stand on  Is it not a saying in every ones mouth Possession is half of the law that is regardless of how the thing came into possession  But often possession is the whole of the law  What are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but FastFish whereof possession is the whole of the law  What to the rapacious landlord is the widows last mite but a FastFish  What is yonder undetected villains marble mansion with a doorplate for a waif what is that but a FastFish  What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai the broker gets from poor Woebegone the bankrupt on a loan to keep Woebegones family from starvation what is that ruinous discount but a FastFish  What is the Archbishop of Savesouls income of L100000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of brokenbacked laborers all sure of heaven without any of Savesouls help what is that globular L100000 but a FastFish  What are the Duke of Dunders hereditary towns and hamlets but FastFish  What to that redoubted harpooneer John Bull is poor Ireland but a FastFish  What to that apostolic lancer Brother Jonathan is Texas but a FastFish  And concerning all these is not Possession the whole of the law  But if the doctrine of FastFish be pretty generally applicable the kindred doctrine of LooseFish is still more widely so  That is internationally and universally applicable  What was America in 1492 but a LooseFish in which Columbus struck the Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress  What was Poland to the Czar  What Greece to the Turk What India to England  What at last will Mexico be to the United States  All LooseFish  What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but LooseFish  What all mens minds and opinions but LooseFish  What is the principle of religious belief in them but a LooseFish  What to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but LooseFish  What is the great globe itself but a LooseFish And what are you reader but a LooseFish and a FastFish too CHAPTER 90  Heads or TailsDe balena vero sufficit si rex habeat caput et regina caudam BRACTON L 3 C 3Latin from the books of the Laws of England which taken along with the context means that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land the King as Honourary Grand Harpooneer must have the head and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail  A division which in the whale is much like halving an apple there is no intermediate remainder  Now as this law under a modified form is to this day in force in England and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and LooseFish it is here treated of in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate car specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty  In the first place in curious proof of the fact that the abovementioned law is still in force I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years  It seems that some honest mariners of Dover or Sandwich or some one of the Cinque Ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore  Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle called a Lord Warden  Holding the office directly from the crown I believe all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his  By some writers this office is called a sinecure But not so  Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them  Now when these poor sunburnt mariners barefooted and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry promising themselves a good L150 from the precious oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives and good ale with their cronies upon the strength of their respective shares up steps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman with a copy of Blackstone under his arm and laying it upon the whales head he saysHands off this fish my masters is a FastFish  I seize it as the Lord Wardens  Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternationso truly Englishknowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger  But that did in nowise mend the matter or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone At length one of them after long scratching about for his ideas made bold to speak  Please sir who is the Lord Warden  The Duke  But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish  It is his  We have been at great trouble and peril and some expense and is all that to go to the Dukes benefit we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters  It is his  Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood  It is his  I thought to relieve my old bedridden mother by part of my share of this whale  It is his  Wont the Duke be content with a quarter or a half  It is his  In a word the whale was seized and sold and his Grace the Duke of Wellington received the money  Thinking that viewed in some particular lights the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed under the circumstances a rather hard one an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration  To which my Lord Duke in substance replied both letters were published that he had already done so and received the money and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverend gentleman would decline meddling with other peoples business  Is this the still militant old man standing at the corners of the three kingdoms on all hands coercing alms of beggars  It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign  We must needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that right  The law itself has already been set forth But Plowdon gives us the reason for it  Says Plowdon the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen because of its superior excellence  And by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters  But why should the King have the head and the Queen the tail  A reason for that ye lawyers  In his treatise on QueenGold or Queenpinmoney an old Kings Bench author one William Prynne thus discourseth Ye tail is ye Queens that ye Queens wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies bodices  But this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne  But is the Queen a mermaid to be presented with a tail  An allegorical meaning may lurk here  There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writersthe whale and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitations and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crowns ordinary revenue  I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality  And thus there seems a reason in all things even in law CHAPTER 91  The Pequod Meets The RoseBudIn vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan insufferable fetor denying not inquiry SIR T BROWNE VEIt was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapoury midday sea that the many noses on the Pequods deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft  A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea  I will bet something now said Stubb that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day  I thought they would keel up before long  Presently the vapours in advance slid aside and there in the distance lay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside  As we glided nearer the stranger showed French colours from his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture seafowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale that is a whale that has died unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse  It may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than an Assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the departed  So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it  Yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality and by no means of the nature of attarofrose  Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first  In truth it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil  Nevertheless in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun blasted whales in general  The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that Stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spadepole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales  Theres a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in the ships bows theres a jackal for ye  I well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery sometimes lowering their boats for breakers mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts yes and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeing that all the oil they will get wont be enough to dip the Captains wick into aye we all know these things but look ye heres a Crappo that is content with our leavings the drugged whale there I mean aye and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there  Poor devil  I say pass round a hat some one and lets make him a present of a little oil for dear charitys sake  For what oil hell get from that drugged whale there wouldnt be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemned cell  And as for the other whale why Ill agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than hell get from that bundle of bones though now that I think of it it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris  I wonder now if our old man has thought of that  Its worth trying Yes Im for it and so saying he started for the quarterdeck  By this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether or no the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again  Issuing from the cabin Stubb now called his boats crew and pulled off for the stranger  Drawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste the upper part of her stempiece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk was painted green and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour  Upon her head boards in large gilt letters he read Bouton de RoseRosebutton or Rosebud and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship  Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription yet the word ROSE and the bulbous figurehead put together sufficiently explained the whole to him  A wooden rosebud eh he cried with his hand to his nose that will do very well but how like all creation it smells  Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side and thus come close to the blasted whale and so talk over it  Arrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he bawledBoutondeRose ahoy are there any of you BoutondeRoses that speak English  Yes rejoined a Guernseyman from the bulwarks who turned out to be the chiefmate  Well then my BoutondeRosebud have you seen the White Whale  WHAT whale  The WHITE Whalea Sperm WhaleMoby Dick have ye seen him  Never heard of such a whale  Cachalot Blanche  White Whaleno  Very good then good bye now and Ill call again in a minute  Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarterdeck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shoutedNo Sir  No  Upon which Ahab retired and Stubb returned to the Frenchman  He now perceived that the Guernseyman who had just got into the chains and was using a cuttingspade had slung his nose in a sort of bag  Whats the matter with your nose there said Stubb  Broke it  I wish it was broken or that I didnt have any nose at all answered the Guernseyman who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much  But what are you holding YOURS for  Oh nothing  Its a wax nose I have to hold it on  Fine day aint it  Air rather gardenny I should say throw us a bunch of posies will ye BoutondeRose  What in the devils name do you want here roared the Guernseyman flying into a sudden passion  Oh keep coolcool yes thats the word why dont you pack those whales in ice while youre working at em  But joking aside though do you know Rosebud that its all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales  As for that dried up one there he hasnt a gill in his whole carcase  I know that well enough but dye see the Captain here wont believe it this is his first voyage he was a Cologne manufacturer before  But come aboard and mayhap hell believe you if he wont me and so Ill get out of this dirty scrape  Anything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined Stubb and with that he soon mounted to the deck  There a queer scene presented itself  The sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales But they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor  All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jibbooms  Now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the masthead to get some fresh air Some thinking they would catch the plague dipped oakum in coaltar and at intervals held it to their nostrils  Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl were vigorously puffing tobaccosmoke so that it constantly filled their olfactories  Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the Captains roundhouse abaft and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar from within  This was the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day had betaken himself to the Captains roundhouse CABINET he called it to avoid the pest but still could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times  Marking all this Stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the Guernseyman had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle  Sounding him carefully Stubb further perceived that the Guernseyman had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris  He therefore held his peace on that head but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity According to this little plan of theirs the Guernseyman under cover of an interpreters office was to tell the Captain what he pleased but as coming from Stubb and as for Stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview  By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin  He was a small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a seacaptain with large whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watchseals at his side  To this gentleman Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernseyman who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them  What shall I say to him first said he  Why said Stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me though I dont pretend to be a judge  He says Monsieur said the Guernseyman in French turning to his captain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captain and chiefmate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside  Upon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know more  What now said the Guernseyman to Stubb  Why since he takes it so easy tell him that now I have eyed him carefully Im quite certain that hes no more fit to command a whaleship than a St Jago monkey  In fact tell him from me hes a baboon  He vows and declares Monsieur that the other whale the dried one is far more deadly than the blasted one in fine Monsieur he conjures us as we value our lives to cut loose from these fish  Instantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cuttingtackles and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship  What now said the Guernseyman when the Captain had returned to them  Why let me see yes you may as well tell him now thatthatin fact tell him Ive diddled him and aside to himself perhaps somebody else  He says Monsieur that hes very happy to have been of any service to us  Hearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties meaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux  He wants you to take a glass of wine with him said the interpreter  Thank him heartily but tell him its against my principles to drink with the man Ive diddled  In fact tell him I must go  He says Monsieur that his principles wont admit of his drinking but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink then Monsieur had best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales for its so calm they wont drift  By this time Stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailed the Guernseyman to this effectthat having a long towline in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ships side  While the Frenchmans boats then were engaged in towing the ship one way Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long towline  Presently a breeze sprang up Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale hoisting his boats the Frenchman soon increased his distance while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubbs whale  Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning  Seizing his sharp boatspade he commenced an excavation in the body a little behind the side fin  You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam His boats crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking as anxious as goldhunters  And all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking and screaming and yelling and fighting around them  Stubb was beginning to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increased when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it as one river will flow into and then along with another without at all blending with it for a time  I have it I have it cried Stubb with delight striking something in the subterranean regions a purse a purse  Dropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese very unctuous and savory withal  You might easily dent it with your thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour  And this good friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist  Some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidably lost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahabs loud command to Stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye CHAPTER 92  AmbergrisNow this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as an article of commerce that in 1791 a certain Nantucketborn Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject  For at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem to the learned  Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber yet the two substances are quite distinct  For amber though at times found on the seacoast is also dug up in some far inland soils whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea  Besides amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for mouthpieces to pipes for beads and ornaments but ambergris is soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely used in perfumery in pastiles precious candles hairpowders and pomatum  The Turks use it in cooking and also carry it to Mecca for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St Peters in Rome  Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret to flavor it  Who would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale  Yet so it is  By some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale  How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administering three or four boat loads of Brandreths pills and then running out of harms way as laborers do in blasting rocks  I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris certain hard round bony plates which at first Stubb thought might be sailors trowsers buttons but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner  Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay is this nothing  Bethink thee of that saying of St Paul in Corinthians about corruption and incorruption how that we are sown in dishonour but raised in glory And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk  Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of illsavor Colognewater in its rudimental manufacturing stages is the worst  I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but cannot owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased minds might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the Frenchmans two whales  Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly untidy business  But there is another thing to rebut  They hint that all whales always smell bad  Now how did this odious stigma originate  I opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling ships in London more than two centuries ago Because those whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large casks and carry it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed forbidding any other course  The consequence is that upon breaking into the hold and unloading one of these whale cemeteries in the Greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city graveyard for the foundations of a LyinginHospital  I partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland in former times of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack in his great work on Smells a textbook on that subject  As its name imports smeer fat berg to put up this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out without being taken home to Holland for that purpose It was a collection of furnaces fatkettles and oil sheds and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor  But all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler which in a voyage of four years perhaps after completely filling her hold with oil does not perhaps consume fifty days in the business of boiling out and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless  The truth is that living or dead if but decently treated whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company by the nose  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when as a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance of exercise always out of doors though it is true seldom in the open air  I say that the motion of a Sperm Whales flukes above water dispenses a perfume as when a muskscented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor  What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance considering his magnitude  Must it not be to that famous elephant with jewelled tusks and redolent with myrrh which was led out of an Indian town to do honour to Alexander the Great CHAPTER 93  The CastawayIt was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequods crew an event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own  Now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats Some few hands are reserved called shipkeepers whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale  As a general thing these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats crews  But if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a shipkeeper  It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nickname Pip by abbreviation  Poor Pip ye have heard of him before ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight so gloomyjolly  In outer aspect Pip and DoughBoy made a match like a black pony and a white one of equal developments though of dissimilar colour driven in one eccentric span  But while hapless DoughBoy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects Pip though over tenderhearted was at bottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer freer relish than any other race  For blacks the years calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixtyfive Fourth of Julys and New Years Days Nor smile so while I write that this little black was brilliant for even blackness has its brilliancy behold yon lustrous ebony panelled in kings cabinets  But Pip loved life and all lifes peaceable securities so that the panicstriking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped had most sadly blurred his brightness though as ere long will be seen what was thus temporarily subdued in him in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut he had once enlivened many a fiddlers frolic on the green and at melodious eventide with his gay haha had turned the round horizon into one starbelled tambourine  So though in the clear air of day suspended against a blueveined neck the purewatered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre he lays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some unnatural gases  Then come out those fiery effulgences infernally superb then the evilblazing diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies looks like some crownjewel stolen from the King of Hell  But let us to the story  It came to pass that in the ambergris affair Stubbs afteroarsman chanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to become quite maimed and temporarily Pip was put into his place  The first time Stubb lowered with him Pip evinced much nervousness but happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale and therefore came off not altogether discreditably though Stubb observing him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost for he might often find it needful  Now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and as the fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which happened in this instance to be right under poor Pips seat  The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so as to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line swiftly straightened and presto poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken several turns around his chest and neck  Tashtego stood in the bows  He was full of the fire of the hunt  He hated Pip for a poltroon  Snatching the boatknife from its sheath he suspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards Stubb exclaimed interrogatively Cut  Meantime Pips blue choked face plainly looked Do for Gods sake  All passed in a flash  In less than half a minute this entire thing happened  Damn him cut roared Stubb and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved  So soon as he recovered himself the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew  Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate Stubb then in a plain businesslike but still half humorous manner cursed Pip officially and that done unofficially gave him much wholesome advice  The substance was Never jump from a boat Pip exceptbut all the rest was indefinite as the soundest advice ever is  Now in general STICK TO THE BOAT is your true motto in whaling but cases will sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT is still better  Moreover as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future Stubb suddenly dropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command Stick to the boat Pip or by the Lord I wont pick you up if you jump mind that  We cant afford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sell for thirty times what you would Pip in Alabama  Bear that in mind and dont jump any more  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted that though man loved his fellow yet man is a moneymaking animal which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence  But we are all in the hands of the Gods and Pip jumped again  It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started to run Pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried travellers trunk  Alas  Stubb was but too true to his word  It was a beautiful bounteous blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatly stretching away all round to the horizon like goldbeaters skin hammered out to the extremest  Bobbing up and down in that sea Pips ebon head showed like a head of cloves  No boatknife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern  Stubbs inexorable back was turned upon him and the whale was winged  In three minutes a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb  Out from the centre of the sea poor Pip turned his crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though the loftiest and the brightest  Now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a springcarriage ashore  But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable  The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity my God who can tell it Mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open seamark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides  But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate No he did not mean to at least  Because there were two boats in his wake and he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly and pick him up though indeed such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances and such instances not unfrequently occur almost invariably in the fishery a coward so called is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies  But it so happened that those boats without seeing Pip suddenly spying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and Stubbs boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish that Pips ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably  By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at least they said he was  The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up but drowned the infinite of his soul  Not drowned entirely though  Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes and the misermerman Wisdom revealed his hoarded heaps and among the joyous heartless everjuvenile eternities Pip saw the multitudinous Godomnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs  He saw Gods foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad  So mans insanity is heavens sense and wandering from all mortal reason man comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised indifferent as his God  For the rest blame not Stubb too hardly  The thing is common in that fishery and in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself CHAPTER 94  A Squeeze of the HandThat whale of Stubbs so dearly purchased was duly brought to the Pequods side where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of the Heidelburgh Tun or Case  While some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled with the sperm and when the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the tryworks of which anon  It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with several others I sat down before a large Constantines bath of it I found it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling about in the liquid part  It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid  A sweet and unctuous duty  No wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic  Such a clearer such a sweetener such a softener such a delicious molifier  After having my hands in it for only a few minutes my fingers felt like eels and began as it were to serpentine and spiralise  As I sat there at my ease crosslegged on the deck after the bitter exertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under indolent sail and gliding so serenely along as I bathed my hands among those soft gentle globules of infiltrated tissues woven almost within the hour as they richly broke to my fingers and discharged all their opulence like fully ripe grapes their wine as I snuffed up that uncontaminated aromaliterally and truly like the smell of spring violets I declare to you that for the time I lived as in a musky meadow I forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible sperm I washed my hands and my heart of it I almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger while bathing in that bath I felt divinely free from all illwill or petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever  Squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my colaborers hands in it mistaking their hands for the gentle globules  Such an abounding affectionate friendly loving feeling did this avocation beget that at last I was continually squeezing their hands and looking up into their eyes sentimentally as much as to sayOh my dear fellow beings why should we longer cherish any social acerbities or know the slightest illhumor or envy  Come let us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze ourselves into each other let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness  Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever  For now since by many prolonged repeated experiences I have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable felicity not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fireside the country now that I have perceived all this I am ready to squeeze case eternally  In thoughts of the visions of the night I saw long rows of angels in paradise each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti  Now while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things akin to it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the tryworks  First comes whitehorse so called which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish and also from the thicker portions of his flukes  It is tough with congealed tendonsa wad of musclebut still contains some oil  After being severed from the whale the whitehorse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer  They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble  Plumpudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whales flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness It is a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold  As its name imports it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple  It is plums of rubies in pictures of citron Spite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from eating it  I confess that once I stole behind the foremast to try it  It tasted something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne  There is another substance and a very singular one which turns up in the course of this business but which I feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe  It is called slobgollion an appellation original with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance  It is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently found in the tubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting  I hold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membranes of the case coalescing  Gurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen  It designates the dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan  Nippers  Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whales vocabulary  But as applied by whalemen it becomes so  A whalemans nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathans tail it averages an inch in thickness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe  Edgewise moved along the oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by nameless blandishments as of magic allures along with it all impurities  But to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is at once to descend into the blubberroom and have a long talk with its inmates  This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanketpieces when stript and hoisted from the whale  When the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros especially by night  On one side lit by a dull lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen They generally go in pairsa pikeandgaffman and a spademan The whalingpike is similar to a frigates boardingweapon of the same name  The gaff is something like a boathook  With his gaff the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold it from slipping as the ship pitches and lurches about  Meanwhile the spademan stands on the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horsepieces  This spade is sharp as hone can make it the spademans feet are shoeless the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him like a sledge  If he cuts off one of his own toes or one of his assistants would you be very much astonished  Toes are scarce among veteran blubberroom men CHAPTER 95  The CassockHad you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this postmortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seen there lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers  Not the wondrous cistern in the whales huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so surprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable conelonger than a Kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jetblack as Yojo the ebony idol of Queequeg  And an idol indeed it is or rather in old times its likeness was Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea and for worshipping which King Asa her son did depose her and destroyed the idol and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings  Look at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along and assisted by two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as the mariners call it and with bowed shoulders staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field Extending it upon the forecastle deck he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt as an African hunter the pelt of a boa This done he turns the pelt inside out like a pantaloon leg gives it a good stretching so as almost to double its diameter and at last hangs it well spread in the rigging to dry  Ere long it is taken down when removing some three feet of it towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two slits for armholes at the other end he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it  The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling Immemorial to all his order this investiture alone will adequately protect him while employed in the peculiar functions of his office  That office consists in mincing the horsepieces of blubber for the pots an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse planted endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious tub beneath it into which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a rapt orators desk  Arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaves what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a Pope were this mincerBible leaves  Bible leaves  This is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer  It enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into as thin slices as possible inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated and its quantity considerably increased besides perhaps improving it in quality CHAPTER 96  The TryWorksBesides her hoisted boats an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her tryworks  She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship  It is as if from the open field a brickkiln were transported to her planks  The tryworks are planted between the foremast and mainmast the most roomy part of the deck  The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar some ten feet by eight square and five in height The foundation does not penetrate the deck but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides and screwing it down to the timbers  On the flanks it is cased with wood and at top completely covered by a large sloping battened hatchway  Removing this hatch we expose the great trypots two in number and each of several barrels capacity  When not in use they are kept remarkably clean  Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand till they shine within like silver punchbowls  During the nightwatches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap  While employed in polishing themone man in each pot side by sidemany confidential communications are carried on over the iron lips  It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation  It was in the left hand trypot of the Pequod with the soapstone diligently circling round me that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend from any point in precisely the same time  Removing the fireboard from the front of the tryworks the bare masonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces directly underneath the pots  These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron  The intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works By a tunnel inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates  There are no external chimneys they open direct from the rear wall  And here let us go back for a moment  It was about nine oclock at night that the Pequods tryworks were first started on this present voyage  It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business  All ready there  Off hatch then and start her  You cook fire the works  This was an easy thing for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage  Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the tryworks has to be fed for a time with wood  After that no wood is used except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel  In a word after being tried out the crisp shrivelled blubber now called scraps or fritters still contains considerable of its unctuous properties These fritters feed the flames  Like a plethoric burning martyr or a selfconsuming misanthrope once ignited the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body  Would that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke is horrible to inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but you must live in it for the time  It has an unspeakable wild Hindoo odor about it such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres  It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment it is an argument for the pit  By midnight the works were in full operation  We were clear from the carcase sail had been made the wind was freshening the wild ocean darkness was intense  But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed Greek fire  The burning ship drove on as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed  So the pitch and sulphurfreighted brigs of the bold Hydriote Canaris issuing from their midnight harbors with broad sheets of flame for sails bore down upon the Turkish frigates and folded them in conflagrations  The hatch removed from the top of the works now afforded a wide hearth in front of them  Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers always the whaleships stokers  With huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots or stirred up the fires beneath till the snaky flames darted curling out of the doors to catch them by the feet  The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps  To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces  Opposite the mouth of the works on the further side of the wide wooden hearth was the windlass  This served for a seasofa  Here lounged the watch when not otherwise employed looking into the red heat of the fire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads  Their tawny features now all begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beards and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works  As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures their tales of terror told in words of mirth as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them like the flames from the furnace as to and fro in their front the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth and viciously spat round her on all sides then the rushing Pequod freighted with savages and laden with fire and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness of darkness seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commanders soul  So seemed it to me as I stood at her helm and for long hours silently guided the way of this fireship on the sea  Wrapped for that interval in darkness myself I but the better saw the redness the madness the ghastliness of others  The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me capering half in smoke and half in fire these at last begat kindred visions in my soul so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm  But that night in particular a strange and ever since inexplicable thing occurred to me  Starting from a brief standing sleep I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong  The jawbone tiller smote my side which leaned against it in my ears was the low hum of sails just beginning to shake in the wind I thought my eyes were open I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart But spite of all this I could see no compass before me to steer by though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it  Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness Uppermost was the impression that whatever swift rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern  A stark bewildered feeling as of death came over me  Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was somehow in some enchanted way inverted  My God what is the matter with me thought I  Lo in my brief sleep I had turned myself about and was fronting the ships stern with my back to her prow and the compass  In an instant I faced back just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind and very probably capsizing her  How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee  Look not too long in the face of the fire O man  Never dream with thy hand on the helm  Turn not thy back to the compass accept the first hint of the hitching tiller believe not the artificial fire when its redness makes all things look ghastly  Tomorrow in the natural sun the skies will be bright those who glared like devils in the forking flames the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the glorious golden glad sun the only true lampall others but liars  Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginias Dismal Swamp nor Romes accursed Campagna nor wide Sahara nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon  The sun hides not the ocean which is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of this earth  So therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him that mortal man cannot be truenot true or undeveloped  With books the same  The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows and the truest of all books is Solomons and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe  All is vanity ALL  This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomons wisdom yet  But he who dodges hospitals and jails and walks fast crossing graveyards and would rather talk of operas than hell calls Cowper Young Pascal Rousseau poor devils all of sick men and throughout a carefree lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise and therefore jollynot that man is fitted to sit down on tombstones and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon  But even Solomon he says the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain IE even while living in the congregation of the dead  Give not thyself up then to fire lest it invert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me  There is a wisdom that is woe but there is a woe that is madness  And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces  And even if he for ever flies within the gorge that gorge is in the mountains so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain even though they soar CHAPTER 97  The LampHad you descended from the Pequods tryworks to the Pequods forecastle where the off duty watch were sleeping for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors  There they lay in their triangular oaken vaults each mariner a chiselled muteness a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes  In merchantmen oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens  To dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in darkness to his pallet this is his usual lot  But the whaleman as he seeks the food of light so he lives in light  He makes his berth an Aladdins lamp and lays him down in it so that in the pitchiest night the ships black hull still houses an illumination  See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lampsoften but old bottles and vials thoughto the copper cooler at the tryworks and replenishes them there as mugs of ale at a vat  He burns too the purest of oil in its unmanufactured and therefore unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar or astral contrivances ashore  It is sweet as early grass butter in April  He goes and hunts for his oil so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game CHAPTER 98  Stowing Down and Clearing UpAlready has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the masthead how he is chased over the watery moors and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep how he is then towed alongside and beheaded and how on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner how in due time he is condemned to the pots and like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego his spermaceti oil and bone pass unscathed through the firebut now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsingsinging if I maythe romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities sliding along beneath the surface as before but alas never more to rise and blow  While still warm the oil like hot punch is received into the sixbarrel casks and while perhaps the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over end for end and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck like so many land slides till at last manhandled and stayed in their course and all round the hoops rap rap go as many hammers as can play upon them for now EX OFFICIO every sailor is a cooper  At length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great hatchways are unsealed the bowels of the ship are thrown open and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea  This done the hatches are replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walled up  In the sperm fishery this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling  One day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil on the sacred quarterdeck enormous masses of the whales head are profanely piled great rusty casks lie about as in a brewery yard the smoke from the tryworks has besooted all the bulwarks the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness the entire ship seems great leviathan himself while on all hands the din is deafening  But a day or two after you look about you and prick your ears in this selfsame ship and were it not for the telltale boats and tryworks you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with a most scrupulously neat commander  The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue  This is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil  Besides from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale a potent lye is readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side that lye quickly exterminates it  Hands go diligently along the bulwarks and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness  The soot is brushed from the lower rigging  All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away  The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the tryworks completely hiding the pots every cask is out of sight all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ships company the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions shift themselves from top to toe and finally issue to the immaculate deck fresh and all aglow as bridegrooms newleaped from out the daintiest Holland  Now with elated step they pace the planks in twos and threes and humorously discourse of parlors sofas carpets and fine cambrics propose to mat the deck think of having hanging to the top object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle  To hint to such musked mariners of oil and bone and blubber were little short of audacity  They know not the thing you distantly allude to  Away and bring us napkins  But mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three men intent on spying out more whales which if caught infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one small greasespot somewhere  Yes and many is the time when after the severest uninterrupted labors which know no night continuing straight through for ninetysix hours when from the boat where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Linethey only step to the deck to carry vast chains and heave the heavy windlass and cut and slash yea and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial tryworks when on the heel of all this they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship and make a spotless dairy room of it many is the time the poor fellows just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks are startled by the cry of There she blows and away they fly to fight another whale and go through the whole weary thing again  Oh my friends but this is mankilling  Yet this is life  For hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this worlds vast bulk its small but valuable sperm and then with weary patience cleansed ourselves from its defilements and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul hardly is this done whenTHERE SHE BLOWSthe ghost is spouted up and away we sail to fight some other world and go through young lifes old routine again  Oh the metempsychosis  Oh  Pythagoras that in bright Greece two thousand years ago did die so good so wise so mild I sailed with thee along the Peruvian coast last voyageand foolish as I am taught thee a green simple boy how to splice a rope CHAPTER 99  The DoubloonEre now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarterdeck taking regular turns at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks when most plunged in his mood he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him  When he halted before the binnacle with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast then as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness only dashed with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness  But one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them  And some certain significance lurks in all things else all things are little worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell by the cartload as they do hills about Boston to fill up some morass in the Milky Way  Now this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over golden sands the headwaters of many a Pactolus flows  And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes yet untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved its Quito glow  Nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last  For it was set apart and sanctified to one awestriking end and however wanton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as the white whales talisman Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he would ever live to spend it  Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and tropic tokenpieces  Here palms alpacas and volcanoes suns disks and stars ecliptics hornsofplenty and rich banners waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through those fancy mints so Spanishly poetic  It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things  On its round border it bore the letters REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR QUITO  So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it and it had been cast midway up the Andes in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn  Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes summits from one a flame a tower on another on the third a crowing cock while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra  Before this equatorial coin Ahab not unobserved by others was now pausing  Theres something ever egotistical in mountaintops and towers and all other grand and lofty things look herethree peaks as proud as Lucifer  The firm tower that is Ahab the volcano that is Ahab the courageous the undaunted and victorious fowl that too is Ahab all are Ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe which like a magicians glass to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self  Great pains small gains for those who ask the world to solve them it cannot solve itself  Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face but see aye he enters the sign of storms the equinox and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries  From storm to storm  So be it then  Born in throes t is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs  So be it then  Heres stout stuff for woe to work on  So be it then  No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold but devils claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday murmured Starbuck to himself leaning against the bulwarks  The old man seems to read Belshazzars awful writing  I have never marked the coin inspectingly  He goes below let me read  A dark valley between three mighty heavenabiding peaks that almost seem the Trinity in some faint earthly symbol  So in this vale of Death God girds us round and over all our gloom the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope  If we bend down our eyes the dark vale shows her mouldy soil but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glance half way to cheer  Yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if at midnight we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him we gaze for him in vain  This coin speaks wisely mildly truly but still sadly to me  I will quit it lest Truth shake me falsely  There nows the old Mogul soliloquized Stubb by the tryworks hes been twigging it and there goes Starbuck from the same and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long  And all from looking at a piece of gold which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaers Hook Id not look at it very long ere spending it  Humph in my poor insignificant opinion I regard this as queer  I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings your doubloons of old Spain your doubloons of Peru your doubloons of Chili your doubloons of Bolivia your doubloons of Popayan with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles and joes and half joes and quarter joes  What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful  By Golconda let me read it once  Halloa heres signs and wonders truly  That now is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac and what my almanac below calls ditto  Ill get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Dabolls arithmetic Ill try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar  Heres the book  Lets see now  Signs and wonders and the sun hes always among em  Hem hem hem here they arehere they goall aliveAries or the Ram Taurus or the Bull and Jimimi heres Gemini himself or the Twins  Well the sun he wheels among em  Aye here on the coin hes just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sittingrooms all in a ring  Book you lie there the fact is you books must know your places  Youll do to give us the bare words and facts but we come in to supply the thoughts  Thats my small experience so far as the Massachusetts calendar and Bowditchs navigator and Dabolls arithmetic go Signs and wonders eh  Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs and significant in wonders  Theres a clue somewhere wait a bit histhark  By Jove I have it  Look you Doubloon your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter and now Ill read it off straight out of the book  Come Almanack  To begin theres Aries or the Ramlecherous dog he begets us then Taurus or the Bullhe bumps us the first thing then Gemini or the Twinsthat is Virtue and Vice we try to reach Virtue when lo comes Cancer the Crab and drags us back and here going from Virtue Leo a roaring Lion lies in the pathhe gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw we escape and hail Virgo the Virgin thats our first love we marry and think to be happy for aye when pop comes Libra or the Scaleshappiness weighed and found wanting and while we are very sad about that Lord how we suddenly jump as Scorpio or the Scorpion stings us in the rear we are curing the wound when whang come the arrows all round Sagittarius or the Archer is amusing himself  As we pluck out the shafts stand aside heres the batteringram Capricornus or the Goat full tilt he comes rushing and headlong we are tossed when Aquarius or the Waterbearer pours out his whole deluge and drowns us and to wind up with Pisces or the Fishes we sleep  Theres a sermon now writ in high heaven and the sun goes through it every year and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty  Jollily he aloft there wheels through toil and trouble and so alow here does jolly Stubb  Oh jollys the word for aye  Adieu Doubloon  But stop here comes little KingPost dodge round the tryworks now and lets hear what hell have to say  There hes before it hell out with something presently  So so hes beginning  I see nothing here but a round thing made of gold and whoever raises a certain whale this round thing belongs to him  So whats all this staring been about  It is worth sixteen dollars thats true and at two cents the cigar thats nine hundred and sixty cigars  I wont smoke dirty pipes like Stubb but I like cigars and heres nine hundred and sixty of them so here goes Flask aloft to spy em out  Shall I call that wise or foolish now if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it yet if it be really foolish then has it a sort of wiseish look to it  But avast here comes our old Manxmanthe old hearsedriver he must have been that is before he took to the sea  He luffs up before the doubloon halloa and goes round on the other side of the mast why theres a horseshoe nailed on that side and now hes back again what does that mean  Hark hes mutteringvoice like an old wornout coffeemill  Prick ears and listen  If the White Whale be raised it must be in a month and a day when the sun stands in some one of these signs  Ive studied signs and know their marks they were taught me two score years ago by the old witch in Copenhagen  Now in what sign will the sun then be  The horseshoe sign for there it is right opposite the gold  And whats the horseshoe sign  The lion is the horseshoe signthe roaring and devouring lion  Ship old ship my old head shakes to think of thee  Theres another rendering now but still one text  All sorts of men in one kind of world you see  Dodge again here comes Queequegall tattooinglooks like the signs of the Zodiac himself  What says the Cannibal  As I live hes comparing notes looking at his thigh bone thinks the sun is in the thigh or in the calf or in the bowels I suppose as the old women talk Surgeons Astronomy in the back country  And by Jove hes found something there in the vicinity of his thighI guess its Sagittarius or the Archer  No he dont know what to make of the doubloon he takes it for an old button off some kings trowsers  But aside again here comes that ghostdevil Fedallah tail coiled out of sight as usual oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual  What does he say with that look of his  Ah only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself there is a sun on the coinfire worshipper depend upon it  Ho more and more  This way comes Pippoor boy would he had died or I hes half horrible to me  He too has been watching all of these interpretersmyself includedand look now he comes to read with that unearthly idiot face  Stand away again and hear him  Hark  I look you look he looks we look ye look they look  Upon my soul hes been studying Murrays Grammar  Improving his mind poor fellow  But whats that he says nowhist  I look you look he looks we look ye look they look  Why hes getting it by hearthist again  I look you look he looks we look ye look they look  Well thats funny  And I you and he and we ye and they are all bats and Im a crow especially when I stand atop of this pine tree here  Caw caw caw caw caw caw  Aint I a crow  And wheres the scarecrow  There he stands two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket  Wonder if he means mecomplimentarypoor ladI could go hang myself  Any way for the present Ill quit Pips vicinity  I can stand the rest for they have plain wits but hes too crazywitty for my sanity  So so I leave him muttering  Heres the ships navel this doubloon here and they are all on fire to unscrew it  But unscrew your navel and whats the consequence  Then again if it stays here that is ugly too for when aughts nailed to the mast its a sign that things grow desperate  Ha ha old Ahab the White Whale hell nail ye  This is a pine tree  My father in old Tolland county cut down a pine tree once and found a silver ring grown over in it some old darkeys wedding ring  How did it get there  And so theyll say in the resurrection when they come to fish up this old mast and find a doubloon lodged in it with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark  Oh the gold the precious precious gold the green miserll hoard ye soon  Hish hish  God goes mong the worlds blackberrying  Cook ho cook and cook us  Jenny hey hey hey hey hey Jenny Jenny and get your hoecake done CHAPTER 100  Leg and Arm  The Pequod of Nantucket Meets the Samuel Enderby of LondonShip ahoy  Hast seen the White Whale  So cried Ahab once more hailing a ship showing English colours bearing down under the stern  Trumpet to mouth the old man was standing in his hoisted quarterboat his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain who was carelessly reclining in his own boats bow  He was a darklytanned burly goodnatured finelooking man of sixty or thereabouts dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round him in festoons of blue pilotcloth and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussars surcoat  Hast seen the White Whale  See you this and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in a wooden head like a mallet  Man my boat cried Ahab impetuously and tossing about the oars near himStand by to lower  In less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and his crew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of the stranger  But here a curious difficulty presented itself  In the excitement of the moment Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moments warning  Now it is no very easy matter for anybodyexcept those who are almost hourly used to it like whalemento clamber up a ships side from a boat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson  So deprived of one leg and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain  It has before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab And in the present instance all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship leaning over the side by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a pair of tastefullyornamented manropes for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a onelegged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters  But this awkwardness only lasted a minute because the strange captain observing at a glance how affairs stood cried out I see I seeavast heaving there Jump boys and swing over the cuttingtackle  As good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous and the great tackles were still aloft and the massive curved blubberhook now clean and dry was still attached to the end  This was quickly lowered to Ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight by pulling handoverhand upon one of the running parts of the tackle  Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks and gently landed upon the capstan head With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome the other captain advanced and Ahab putting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like two swordfish blades cried out in his walrus way Aye aye hearty let us shake bones togetheran arm and a legan arm that never can shrink dye see and a leg that never can run  Where didst thou see the White Whalehow long ago  The White Whale said the Englishman pointing his ivory arm towards the East and taking a rueful sight along it as if it had been a telescope there I saw him on the Line last season  And he took that arm off did he asked Ahab now sliding down from the capstan and resting on the Englishmans shoulder as he did so  Aye he was the cause of it at least and that leg too  Spin me the yarn said Ahab how was it  It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line began the Englishman  I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time  Well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales and my boat fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too that went milling and milling round so that my boats crew could only trim dish by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milkywhite head and hump all crows feet and wrinkles  It was he it was he cried Ahab suddenly letting out his suspended breath  And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin  Aye ayethey were mineMY irons cried Ahab exultinglybut on  Give me a chance then said the Englishman goodhumoredly Well this old greatgrandfather with the white head and hump runs all afoam into the pod and goes to snapping furiously at my fastline  Aye I seewanted to part it free the fastfishan old trickI know him  How it was exactly continued the onearmed commander I do not know but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there somehow but we didnt know it then so that when we afterwards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other whales that went off to windward all fluking  Seeing how matters stood and what a noble great whale it wasthe noblest and biggest I ever saw sir in my lifeI resolved to capture him spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in  And thinking the haphazard line would get loose or the tooth it was tangled to might draw for I have a devil of a boats crew for a pull on a whaleline seeing all this I say I jumped into my first mates boatMr Mounttops here by the way CaptainMounttop Mounttopthe captainas I was saying I jumped into Mounttops boat which dye see was gunwale and gunwale with mine then and snatching the first harpoon let this old greatgrandfather have it But Lord look you sirhearts and souls alive manthe next instant in a jiff I was blind as a batboth eyes outall befogged and bedeadened with black foamthe whales tail looming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple  No use sterning all then but as I was groping at midday with a blinding sun all crownjewels as I was groping I say after the second iron to toss it overboarddown comes the tail like a Lima tower cutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinters and flukes first the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was all chips  We all struck out  To escape his terrible flailings I seized hold of my harpoonpole sticking in him and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish  But a combing sea dashed me off and at the same instant the fish taking one good dart forwards went down like a flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder yes caught me just here I say and bore me down to Hells flames I was thinking when when all of a sudden thank the good God the barb ript its way along the fleshclear along the whole length of my armcame out nigh my wrist and up I floatedand that gentleman there will tell you the rest by the way captainDr Bunger ships surgeon Bunger my ladthe captain  Now Bunger boy spin your part of the yarn  The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been all the time standing near them with nothing specific visible to denote his gentlemanly rank on board  His face was an exceedingly round but sober one he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and patched trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand and a pillbox held in the other occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains  But at his superiors introduction of him to Ahab he politely bowed and straightway went on to do his captains bidding  It was a shocking bad wound began the whalesurgeon and taking my advice Captain Boomer here stood our old Sammy  Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the onearmed captain addressing Ahab go on boy  Stood our old Sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the Line  But it was no useI did all I could sat up with him nights was very severe with him in the matter of diet  Oh very severe chimed in the patient himself then suddenly altering his voice Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night till he couldnt see to put on the bandages and sending me to bed half seas over about three oclock in the morning  Oh ye stars he sat up with me indeed and was very severe in my diet  Oh a great watcher and very dietetically severe is Dr Bunger Bunger you dog laugh out why dont ye  You know youre a precious jolly rascal But heave ahead boy Id rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man  My captain you must have ere this perceived respected sirsaid the imperturbable godlylooking Bunger slightly bowing to Ahabis apt to be facetious at times he spins us many clever things of that sort  But I may as well sayen passant as the French remarkthat I myselfthat is to say Jack Bunger late of the reverend clergyam a strict total abstinence man I never drink  Water cried the captain he never drinks it its a sort of fits to him fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia but go ongo on with the arm story  Yes I may as well said the surgeon coolly  I was about observing sir before Captain Boomers facetious interruption that spite of my best and severest endeavors the wound kept getting worse and worse the truth was sir it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw more than two feet and several inches long  I measured it with the lead line  In short it grew black I knew what was threatened and off it came  But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there that thing is against all rulepointing at it with the marlingspikethat is the captains work not mine he ordered the carpenter to make it he had that clubhammer there put to the end to knock some ones brains out with I suppose as he tried mine once  He flies into diabolical passions sometimes  Do ye see this dent sirremoving his hat and brushing aside his hair and exposing a bowllike cavity in his skull but which bore not the slightest scarry trace or any token of ever having been a woundWell the captain there will tell you how that came here he knows  No I dont said the captain but his mother did he was born with it  Oh you solemn rogue youyou Bunger was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world  Bunger when you die you ought to die in pickle you dog you should be preserved to future ages you rascal  What became of the White Whale now cried Ahab who thus far had been impatiently listening to this byplay between the two Englishmen  Oh cried the onearmed captain oh yes  Well after he sounded we didnt see him again for some time in fact as I before hinted I didnt then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick till some time afterwards when coming back to the Line we heard about Moby Dickas some call himand then I knew it was he  Didst thou cross his wake again  Twice  But could not fasten  Didnt want to try to aint one limb enough  What should I do without this other arm  And Im thinking Moby Dick doesnt bite so much as he swallows  Well then interrupted Bunger give him your left arm for bait to get the right  Do you know gentlemenvery gravely and mathematically bowing to each Captain in successionDo you know gentlemen that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a mans arm  And he knows it too  So that what you take for the White Whales malice is only his awkwardness For he never means to swallow a single limb he only thinks to terrify by feints  But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon that making believe swallow jackknives once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more when I gave him an emetic and he heaved it up in small tacks dye see  No possible way for him to digest that jackknife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system  Yes Captain Boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other why in that case the arm is yours only let the whale have another chance at you shortly thats all  No thank ye Bunger said the English Captain hes welcome to the arm he has since I cant help it and didnt know him then but not to another one  No more White Whales for me Ive lowered for him once and that has satisfied me  There would be great glory in killing him I know that and there is a shipload of precious sperm in him but hark ye hes best let alone dont you think so Captainglancing at the ivory leg  He is  But he will still be hunted for all that  What is best let alone that accursed thing is not always what least allures  Hes all a magnet  How long since thou sawst him last  Which way heading  Bless my soul and curse the foul fiends cried Bunger stoopingly walking round Ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this mans bloodbring the thermometerits at the boiling pointhis pulse makes these planks beatsirtaking a lancet from his pocket and drawing near to Ahabs arm  Avast roared Ahab dashing him against the bulwarksMan the boat  Which way heading  Good God cried the English Captain to whom the question was put Whats the matter  He was heading east I thinkIs your Captain crazy whispering Fedallah  But Fedallah putting a finger on his lip slid over the bulwarks to take the boats steering oar and Ahab swinging the cuttingtackle towards him commanded the ships sailors to stand by to lower  In a moment he was standing in the boats stern and the Manilla men were springing to their oars  In vain the English Captain hailed him  With back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod CHAPTER 101  The DecanterEre the English ship fades from sight be it set down here that she hailed from London and was named after the late Samuel Enderby merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby  Sons a house which in my poor whalemans opinion comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons in point of real historical interest  How long prior to the year of our Lord 1775 this great whaling house was in existence my numerous fishdocuments do not make plain but in that year 1775 it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale though for some score of years previous ever since 1726 our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan but only in the North and South Atlantic not elsewhere  Be it distinctly recorded here that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him  In 1778 a fine ship the Amelia fitted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys boldly rounded Cape Horn and was the first among the nations to lower a whaleboat of any sort in the great South Sea  The voyage was a skilful and lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the Amelias example was soon followed by other ships English and American and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open  But not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again bestirred itself Samuel and all his Sonshow many their mother only knowsand under their immediate auspices and partly I think at their expense the British government was induced to send the sloopofwar Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea  Commanded by a naval PostCaptain the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it and did some service how much does not appear  But this is not all  In 1819 the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan  That shipwell called the Syrenmade a noble experimental cruise and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin a Nantucketer  All honour to the Enderbies therefore whose house I think exists to the present day though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world  The ship named after him was worthy of the honour being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way  I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the forecastle  It was a fine gam we had and they were all trumpsevery soul on board  A short life to them and a jolly death  And that fine gam I hadlong very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heelit minds me of the noble solid Saxon hospitality of that ship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if I ever lose sight of it  Flip  Did I say we had flip  Yes and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour and when the squall came for its squally off there by Patagonia and all handsvisitors and allwere called to reef topsails we were so topheavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the howling gale a warning example to all drunken tars  However the masts did not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we had to pass the flip again though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste  The beef was finetough but with body in it  They said it was bullbeef others that it was dromedary beef but I do not know for certain how that was  They had dumplings too small but substantial symmetrically globular and indestructible dumplings  I fancied that you could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swallowed  If you stooped over too far forward you risked their pitching out of you like billiardballs  The breadbut that couldnt be helped besides it was an antiscorbutic in short the bread contained the only fresh fare they had  But the forecastle was not very light and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it  But all in all taking her from truck to helm considering the dimensions of the cooks boilers including his own live parchment boilers fore and aft I say the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship of good fare and plenty fine flip and strong crack fellows all and capital from boot heels to hatband  But why was it think ye that the Samuel Enderby and some other English whalers I know ofnot all thoughwere such famous hospitable ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing  I will tell you  The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research  Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale research when it has seemed needed  The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders Zealanders and Danes from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashions touching plenty to eat and drink  For as a general thing the English merchantship scrimps her crew but not so the English whaler  Hence in the English this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special origin which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated  During my researches in the Leviathanic histories I stumbled upon an ancient Dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it I knew must be about whalers  The title was Dan Coopman wherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper  I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one Fitz Swackhammer  But my friend Dr Snodhead a very learned man professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St Potts to whom I handed the work for translation giving him a box of sperm candles for his troublethis same Dr Snodhead so soon as he spied the book assured me that Dan Coopman did not mean The Cooper but The Merchant  In short this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland and among other subjects contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery  And in this chapter it was headed Smeer or Fat that I found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen from which list as translated by Dr Snodhead I transcribe the following  400000 lbs of beef 60000 lbs Friesland pork 150000 lbs of stock fish 550000 lbs of biscuit 72000 lbs of soft bread 2800 firkins of butter 20000 lbs Texel  Leyden cheese 144000 lbs cheese probably an inferior article 550 ankers of Geneva 10800 barrels of beer  Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so in the present case however where the reader is flooded with whole pipes barrels quarts and gills of good gin and good cheer  At the time I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer beef and bread during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendental and Platonic application and furthermore I compiled supplementary tables of my own touching the probable quantity of stockfish etc consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery  In the first place the amount of butter and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed seems amazing  I impute it though to their naturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil  The quantity of beer too is very large 10800 barrels  Now as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea did not much exceed three months say and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail we have 5400 Low Dutch seamen in all therefore I say we have precisely two barrels of beer per man for a twelve weeks allowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin  Now whether these gin and beer harpooneers so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a boats head and take good aim at flying whales this would seem somewhat improbable  Yet they did aim at them and hit them too  But this was very far North be it remembered where beer agrees well with the constitution upon the Equator in our southern fishery beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the masthead and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford  But no more enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers and that the English whalers have not neglected so excellent an example  For say they when cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of the world get a good dinner out of it at least  And this empties the decanter CHAPTER 102  A Bower in the ArsacidesHitherto in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features  But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now to unbutton him still further and untagging the points of his hose unbuckling his garters and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in his unconditional skeleton  But how now Ishmael  How is it that you a mere oarsman in the fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale  Did erudite Stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a specimen rib for exhibition  Explain thyself Ishmael Can you land a fullgrown whale on your deck for examination as a cook dishes a roastpig  Surely not  A veritable witness have you hitherto been Ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the rafters ridgepole sleepers and underpinnings making up the framework of leviathan and belike of the tallowvats dairyrooms butteries and cheeseries in his bowels  I confess that since Jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless I have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature  In a ship I belonged to a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and for the heads of the lances  Think you I let that chance go without using my boathatchet and jackknife and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub  And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge I am indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo king of Tranque one of the Arsacides  For being at Tranque years ago when attached to the tradingship Dey of Algiers I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque at his retired palm villa at Pupella a seaside glen not very far distant from what our sailors called BambooTown his capital  Among many other fine qualities my royal friend Tranquo being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had brought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices chiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders the wonderfreighted tributerendering waves had cast upon his shores  Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale which after an unusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his head against a cocoanut tree whose plumagelike tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet  When the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathomdeep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry in the sun then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it  The ribs were hung with trophies the vertebrae were carved with Arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapoury spout while suspended from a bough the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees like the hairhung sword that so affrighted Damocles  It was a wondrous sight  The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen the trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the industrious earth beneath was as a weavers loom with a gorgeous carpet on it whereof the groundvine tendrils formed the warp and woof and the living flowers the figures  All the trees with all their laden branches all the shrubs and ferns and grasses the messagecarrying air all these unceasingly were active  Through the lacings of the leaves the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure  Oh busy weaver unseen weaverpauseone wordwhither flows the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore all these ceaseless toilings  Speak weaverstay thy handbut one single word with thee  Naythe shuttle fliesthe figures float from forth the loom the freshetrushing carpet for ever slides away  The weavergod he weaves and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal voice and by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it  For even so it is in all material factories  The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles those same words are plainly heard without the walls bursting from the opened casements  Thereby have villainies been detected  Ah mortal then be heedful for so in all this din of the great worlds loom thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar  Now amid the green liferestless loom of that Arsacidean wood the great white worshipped skeleton lay lounginga gigantic idler Yet as the everwoven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven over with the vines every month assuming greener fresher verdure but himself a skeleton  Life folded Death Death trellised Life the grim god wived with youthful Life and begat him curlyheaded glories  Now when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale and saw the skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu  He laughed  But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine  To and fro I paced before this skeletonbrushed the vines asidebroke through the ribsand with a ball of Arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid its many winding shaded colonnades and arbours  But soon my line was out and following it back I emerged from the opening where I entered  I saw no living thing within naught was there but bones  Cutting me a green measuringrod I once more dived within the skeleton  From their arrowslit in the skull the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib How now they shouted Darst thou measure this our god  Thats for us  Aye priestswell how long do ye make him then  But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them concerning feet and inches they cracked each others sconces with their yardsticksthe great skull echoedand seizing that lucky chance I quickly concluded my own admeasurements  These admeasurements I now propose to set before you  But first be it recorded that in this matter I am not free to utter any fancied measurement I please  Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to to test my accuracy  There is a Leviathanic Museum they tell me in Hull England one of the whaling ports of that country where they have some fine specimens of finbacks and other whales  Likewise I have heard that in the museum of Manchester in New Hampshire they have what the proprietors call the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States Moreover at a place in Yorkshire England Burton Constable by name a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale but of moderate size by no means of the fullgrown magnitude of my friend King Tranquos  In both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds  King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and Sir Clifford because he was lord of the seignories of those parts  Sir Cliffords whale has been articulated throughout so that like a great chest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bony cavitiesspread out his ribs like a gigantic fanand swing all day upon his lower jaw  Locks are to be put upon some of his trapdoors and shutters and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side  Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead  The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm where I had them tattooed as in my wild wanderings at that period there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics  But as I was crowded for space and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composingat least what untattooed parts might remainI did not trouble myself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale CHAPTER 103  Measurement of The Whales SkeletonIn the first place I wish to lay before you a particular plain statement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit  Such a statement may prove useful here  According to a careful calculation I have made and which I partly base upon Captain Scoresbys estimate of seventy tons for the largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length according to my careful calculation I say a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude between eightyfive and ninety feet in length and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants  Think you not then that brains like yoked cattle should be put to this leviathan to make him at all budge to any landsmans imagination  Having already in various ways put before you his skull spouthole jaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts I shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones  But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by far the most complicated part and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under your arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view  In length the Sperm Whales skeleton at Tranque measured seventytwo Feet so that when fully invested and extended in life he must have been ninety feet long for in the whale the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body  Of this seventytwo feet his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet leaving some fifty feet of plain backbone  Attached to this backbone for something less than a third of its length was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals  To me this vast ivoryribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine extending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembled the hull of a great ship newlaid upon the stocks when only some twenty of her naked bowribs are inserted and the keel is otherwise for the time but a long disconnected timber  The ribs were ten on a side  The first to begin from the neck was nearly six feet long the second third and fourth were each successively longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or one of the middle ribs which measured eight feet and some inches  From that part the remaining ribs diminished till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches  In general thickness they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length  The middle ribs were the most arched  In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams  In considering these ribs I could not but be struck anew with the circumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form  The largest of the Tranque ribs one of the middle ones occupied that part of the fish which in life is greatest in depth  Now the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet  So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part  Besides for some way where I now saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowels  Still more for the ample fins I here saw but a few disordered joints and in place of the weighty and majestic but boneless flukes an utter blank  How vain and foolish then thought I for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood  No Only in the heart of quickest perils only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out  But the spine  For that the best way we can consider it is with a crane to pile its bones high up on end  No speedy enterprise  But now its done it looks much like Pompeys Pillar  There are forty and odd vertebrae in all which in the skeleton are not locked together  They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry  The largest a middle one is in width something less than three feet and in depth more than four  The smallest where the spine tapers away into the tail is only two inches in width and looks something like a white billiardball  I was told that there were still smaller ones but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins the priests children who had stolen them to play marbles with  Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple childs play CHAPTER 104  The Fossil WhaleFrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate  Would you you could not compress him  By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio  Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail and the yards he measures about the waist only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlopdeck of a lineofbattleship  Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels  Having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological fossiliferous and antediluvian point of view  Applied to any other creature than the Leviathanto an ant or a fleasuch portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent  But when Leviathan is the text the case is altered  Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary  And here be it said that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson expressly purchased for that purpose because that famous lexicographers uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me  One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject though it may seem but an ordinary one  How then with me writing of this Leviathan  Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals  Give me a condors quill  Give me Vesuvius crater for an inkstand  Friends hold my arms  For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan they weary me and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep as if to include the whole circle of the sciences and all the generations of whales and men and mastodons past present and to come with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not excluding its suburbs  Such and so magnifying is the virtue of a large and liberal theme  We expand to its bulk  To produce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme  No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea though many there be who have tried it  Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales I present my credentials as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stonemason and also a great digger of ditches canals and wells winevaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts Likewise by way of preliminary I desire to remind the reader that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting or at any rate intercepted links between the antichronical creatures and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period which is the last preceding the superficial formations  And though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils  Detached broken fossils of preadamite whales fragments of their bones and skeletons have within thirty years past at various intervals been found at the base of the Alps in Lombardy in France in England in Scotland and in the States of Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama  Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp in Napoleons time  Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic species  But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year 1842 on the plantation of Judge Creagh in Alabama  The awestricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels  The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus  But some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen the English Anatomist it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale though of a departed species  A significant illustration of the fact again and again repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body  So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon and in his paper read before the London Geological Society pronounced it in substance one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence  When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons skulls tusks jaws ribs and vertebrae all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of seamonsters but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans their incalculable seniors I am by a flood borne back to that wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begun for time began with man  Here Saturns grey chaos rolls over me and I obtain dim shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics and in all the 25000 miles of this worlds circumference not an inhabitable hands breadth of land was visible  Then the whole world was the whales and king of creation he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs  Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan  Ahabs harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaohs  Methuselah seems a schoolboy  I look round to shake hands with Shem  I am horrorstruck at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale which having been before all time must needs exist after all humane ages are over  But not alone has this Leviathan left his preadamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust but upon Egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakable print of his fin  In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah some fifty years ago there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaurs griffins and dolphins similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns  Gliding among them old Leviathan swam as of yore was there swimming in that planisphere centuries before Solomon was cradled  Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale in his own osseous postdiluvian reality as set down by the venerable John Leo the old Barbary traveller  Not far from the Seaside they have a Temple the Rafters and Beams of which are made of WhaleBones for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore  The Common People imagine that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple no Whale can pass it without immediate death  But the truth of the Matter is that on either side of the Temple there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea and wound the Whales when they light upon em They keep a Whales Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle which lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost makes an Arch the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camels Back This Rib says John Leo is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it  Their Historians affirm that a Prophet who prophesyd of Mahomet came from this Temple and some do not stand to assert that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple  In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you reader and if you be a Nantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship there CHAPTER 105  Does the Whales Magnitude DiminishWill He PerishInasmuch then as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the headwaters of the Eternities it may be fitly inquired whether in the long course of his generations he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires  But upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period prior to man but of the whales found in that Tertiary system those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones  Of all the preadamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton  Whereas we have already seen that the tapemeasure gives seventytwo feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale  And I have heard on whalemens authority that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture  But may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods may it not be that since Adams time they have degenerated  Assuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny and the ancient naturalists generally  For Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in lengthRope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales  And even in the days of Banks and Solander Cookes naturalists we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales reydansiskur or Wrinkled Bellies at one hundred and twenty yards that is three hundred and sixty feet  And Lacepede the French naturalist in his elaborate history of whales in the very beginning of his work page 3 sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres three hundred and twentyeight feet  And this work was published so late as AD 1825  But will any whaleman believe these stories  No  The whale of today is as big as his ancestors in Plinys time  And if ever I go where Pliny is I a whaleman more than he was will make bold to tell him so  Because I cannot understand how it is that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets by the relative proportions in which they are drawn just as plainly prove that the highbred stallfed prize cattle of Smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaohs fat kine in the face of all this I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated  But still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the more recondite Nantucketers  Whether owing to the almost omniscient lookouts at the mastheads of the whaleships now penetrating even through Behrings straits and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts the moot point is whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters and the last whale like the last man smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the final puff  Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo which not forty years ago overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois and Missouri and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunderclotted brows upon the sites of populous rivercapitals where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction  But you must look at this matter in every light  Though so short a period agonot a good lifetimethe census of the buffalo in Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man yet the far different nature of the whalehunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan  Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for fortyeight months think they have done extremely well and thank God if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish  Whereas in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West when the far west in whose sunset suns still rise was a wilderness and a virgin the same number of moccasined men for the same number of months mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships would have slain not forty but forty thousand and more buffaloes a fact that if need were could be statistically stated  Nor considered aright does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale for example that in former years the latter part of the last century say these Leviathans in small pods were encountered much oftener than at present and in consequence the voyages were not so prolonged and were also much more remunerative  Because as has been elsewhere noticed those whales influenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immense caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes and pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated unfrequent armies  That is all  And equally fallacious seems the conceit that because the socalled whalebone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them hence that species also is declining  For they are only being driven from promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets then be sure some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle  Furthermore concerning these last mentioned Leviathans they have two firm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain impregnable  And as upon the invasion of their valleys the frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains so hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas the whalebone whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed circle of everlasting December bid defiance to all pursuit from man  But as perhaps fifty of these whalebone whales are harpooned for one cachalot some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions  But though for some time past a number of these whales not less than 13000 have been annually slain on the norwest coast by the Americans alone yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter  Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe yet what shall we say to Harto the historian of Goa when he tells us that at one hunting the King of Siam took 4000 elephants that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes  And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants which have now been hunted for thousands of years by Semiramis by Porus by Hannibal and by all the successive monarchs of the Eastif they still survive there in great numbers much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since he has a pasture to expatiate in which is precisely twice as large as all Asia both Americas Europe and Africa New Holland and all the Isles of the sea combined  Moreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity of whales their probably attaining the age of a century and more therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generations must be contemporary  And what that is we may soon gain some idea of by imagining all the graveyards cemeteries and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men women and children who were alive seventyfive years ago and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe  Wherefore for all these things we account the whale immortal in his species however perishable in his individuality  He swam the seas before the continents broke water he once swam over the site of the Tuileries and Windsor Castle and the Kremlin  In Noahs flood he despised Noahs Ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded like the Netherlands to kill off its rats then the eternal whale will still survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood spout his frothed defiance to the skies CHAPTER 106  Ahabs LegThe precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby of London had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person  He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a halfsplintering shock And when after gaining his own deck and his own pivothole there he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it was as ever something about his not steering inflexibly enough then the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench that though it still remained entire and to all appearances lusty yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy  And indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all his pervading mad recklessness Ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood  For it had not been very long prior to the Pequods sailing from Nantucket that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground and insensible by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty his ivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had stakewise smitten and all but pierced his groin nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured  Nor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable events do naturally beget their like Yea more than equally thought Ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy For not to hint of this that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world but on the contrary shall be followed by the joychildlessness of all hells despair whereas some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing  For thought Ahab while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracingsout not belie the obvious deduction  To trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods so that in the face of all the glad haymaking suns and soft cymballing round harvestmoons we must needs give in to this that the gods themselves are not for ever glad  The ineffaceable sad birthmark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers  Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged which perhaps might more properly in set way have been disclosed before  With many other particulars concerning Ahab always had it remained a mystery to some why it was that for a certain period both before and after the sailing of the Pequod he had hidden himself away with such GrandLamalike exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge as it were among the marble senate of the dead Captain Pelegs bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate though indeed as touching all Ahabs deeper part every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light  But in the end it all came out this one matter did at least  That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness  And not only this but to that evercontracting dropping circle ashore who for any reason possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him to that timid circle the above hinted casualtyremaining as it did moodily unaccounted for by Ahabinvested itself with terrors not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails  So that through their zeal for him they had all conspired so far as in them lay to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others and hence it was that not till a considerable interval had elapsed did it transpire upon the Pequods decks  But be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do or not with earthly Ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took plain practical procedureshe called the carpenter  And when that functionary appeared before him he bade him without delay set about making a new leg and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jawivory Sperm Whale which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a careful selection of the stoutest clearestgrained stuff might be secured  This done the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night and to provide all the fittings for it independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use Moreover the ships forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate the affair the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed CHAPTER 107  The CarpenterSeat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn and take high abstracted man alone and he seems a wonder a grandeur and a woe But from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary and hereditary  But most humble though he was and far from furnishing an example of the high humane abstraction the Pequods carpenter was no duplicate hence he now comes in person on this stage  Like all seagoing ship carpenters and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels he was to a certain offhanded practical extent alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own the carpenters pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material  But besides the application to him of the generic remark above this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship upon a three or four years voyage in uncivilized and fardistant seas  For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary dutiesrepairing stove boats sprung spars reforming the shape of clumsybladed oars inserting bulls eyes in the deck or new treenails in the side planks and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes both useful and capricious  The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold was his vicebench a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices of different sizes and both of iron and of wood At all times except when whales were alongside this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Tryworks  A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole the carpenter claps it into one of his everready vices and straightway files it smaller  A lost landbird of strange plumage strays on board and is made a captive out of clean shaved rods of rightwhale bone and crossbeams of sperm whale ivory the carpenter makes a pagodalooking cage for it  An oarsman sprains his wrist the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion  Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar screwing each oar in his big vice of wood the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation  A sailor takes a fancy to wear sharkbone earrings the carpenter drills his ears  Another has the toothache the carpenter out pincers and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation whirling round the handle of his wooden vice the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth  Thus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indifferent and without respect in all  Teeth he accounted bits of ivory heads he deemed but topblocks men themselves he lightly held for capstans  But while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence  But not precisely so  For nothing was this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were impersonal I say for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes still eternally holds its peace and ignores you though you dig foundations for cathedrals  Yet was this halfhorrible stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an allramifying heartlessnessyet was it oddly dashed at times with an old crutchlike antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noahs ark  Was it that this old carpenter had been a lifelong wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him  He was a stript abstract an unfractioned integral uncompromised as a newborn babe living without premeditated reference to this world or the next  You might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because he had been tutored to it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process  He was a pure manipulator his brain if he had ever had one must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers  He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful MULTUM IN PARVO Sheffield contrivances assuming the exteriorthough a little swelledof a common pocket knife but containing not only blades of various sizes but also screwdrivers corkscrews tweezers awls pens rulers nailfilers countersinkers  So if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screwdriver all they had to do was to open that part of him and the screw was fast or if for tweezers take him up by the legs and there they were  Yet as previously hinted this omnitooled openandshut carpenter was after all no mere machine of an automaton  If he did not have a common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty  What that was whether essence of quicksilver or a few drops of hartshorn there is no telling  But there it was and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more  And this it was this same unaccountable cunning lifeprinciple in him this it was that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body was a sentrybox and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himself awake CHAPTER 108  Ahab and the Carpenter  The DeckFirst Night WatchCARPENTER STANDING BEFORE HIS VICEBENCH AND BY THE LIGHT OF TWO LANTERNS BUSILY FILING THE IVORY JOIST FOR THE LEG WHICH JOIST IS FIRMLY FIXED IN THE VICE  SLABS OF IVORY LEATHER STRAPS PADS SCREWS AND VARIOUS TOOLS OF ALL SORTS LYING ABOUT THE BENCH FORWARD THE RED FLAME OF THE FORGE IS SEEN WHERE THE BLACKSMITH IS AT WORKDrat the file and drat the bone  That is hard which should be soft and that is soft which should be hard  So we go who file old jaws and shinbones  Lets try another  Aye now this works better SNEEZES  Halloa this bone dust is SNEEZESwhy its SNEEZESyes its SNEEZESbless my soul it wont let me speak This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber  Saw a live tree and you dont get this dust amputate a live bone and you dont get it SNEEZES  Come come you old Smut there bear a hand and lets have that ferule and bucklescrew Ill be ready for them presently  Lucky now SNEEZES theres no kneejoint to make that might puzzle a little but a mere shinbonewhy its easy as making hoppoles only I should like to put a good finish on Time time if I but only had the time I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever SNEEZES scraped to a lady in a parlor  Those buckskin legs and calves of legs Ive seen in shop windows wouldnt compare at all  They soak water they do and of course get rheumatic and have to be doctored SNEEZES with washes and lotions just like live legs  There before I saw it off now I must call his old Mogulship and see whether the length will be all right too short if anything I guess  Ha thats the heel we are in luck here he comes or its somebody else thats certain  AHAB ADVANCING  DURING THE ENSUING SCENE THE CARPENTER CONTINUES SNEEZING AT TIMESWell manmaker  Just in time sir  If the captain pleases I will now mark the length  Let me measure sir  Measured for a leg good  Well its not the first time  About it There keep thy finger on it  This is a cogent vice thou hast here carpenter let me feel its grip once  So so it does pinch some  Oh sir it will break bonesbeware beware  No fear I like a good grip I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold man  Whats Prometheus about therethe blacksmith I meanwhats he about  He must be forging the bucklescrew sir now  Right  Its a partnership he supplies the muscle part  He makes a fierce red flame there  Aye sir he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work  Umm  So he must  I do deem it now a most meaning thing that that old Greek Prometheus who made men they say should have been a blacksmith and animated them with fire for whats made in fire must properly belong to fire and so hells probable  How the soot flies This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of Carpenter when hes through with that buckle tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulderblades theres a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack  Sir  Hold while Prometheus is about it Ill order a complete man after a desirable pattern  Imprimis fifty feet high in his socks then chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel then legs with roots to em to stay in one place then arms three feet through the wrist no heart at all brass forehead and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains and let me seeshall I order eyes to see outwards  No but put a skylight on top of his head to illuminate inwards  There take the order and away  Now whats he speaking about and whos he speaking to I should like to know  Shall I keep standing here ASIDE  Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome heres one No no no I must have a lantern  Ho ho  Thats it hey  Here are two sir one will serve my turn  What art thou thrusting that thiefcatcher into my face for man Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols  I thought sir that you spoke to carpenterCarpenter why thatsbut noa very tidy and I may say an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here carpenteror wouldst thou rather work in clay  SirClay clay sir  Thats mud we leave clay to ditchers sir  The fellows impious  What art thou sneezing about  Bone is rather dusty sir  Take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyself under living peoples noses  Siroh ahI guess soyesdear  Look ye carpenter I dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman eh  Well then will it speak thoroughly well for thy work if when I come to mount this leg thou makest I shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it that is carpenter my old lost leg the flesh and blood one I mean Canst thou not drive that old Adam away  Truly sir I begin to understand somewhat now  Yes I have heard something curious on that score sir how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar but it will be still pricking him at times  May I humbly ask if it be really so sir  It is man  Look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was so now here is only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the soul  Where thou feelest tingling life there exactly there there to a hair do I  Ist a riddle  I should humbly call it a poser sir  Hist then  How dost thou know that some entire living thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest aye and standing there in thy spite  In thy most solitary hours then dost thou not fear eavesdroppers  Hold dont speak  And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg though it be now so long dissolved then why mayst not thou carpenter feel the fiery pains of hell for ever and without a body  Hah  Good Lord  Truly sir if it comes to that I must calculate over again I think I didnt carry a small figure sir  Look ye puddingheads should never grant premisesHow long before the leg is done  Perhaps an hour sir  Bungle away at it then and bring it to me TURNS TO GO  Oh Life Here I am proud as Greek god and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on  Cursed be that mortal interindebtedness which will not do away with ledgers  I would be free as air and Im down in the whole worlds books  I am so rich I could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Praetorians at the auction of the Roman empire which was the worlds and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with  By heavens  Ill get a crucible and into it and dissolve myself down to one small compendious vertebra  So  CARPENTER RESUMING HIS WORKWell well well  Stubb knows him best of all and Stubb always says hes queer says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer hes queer says Stubb hes queerqueer queer and keeps dinning it into Mr Starbuck all the timequeersirqueer queer very queer  And heres his leg  Yes now that I think of it heres his bedfellow has a stick of whales jawbone for a wife  And this is his leg hell stand on this  What was that now about one leg standing in three places and all three places standing in one hellhow was that  Oh  I dont wonder he looked so scornful at me Im a sort of strangethoughted sometimes they say but thats only haphazardlike  Then a short little old body like me should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall heronbuilt captains the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick and theres a great cry for lifeboats  And heres the herons leg long and slim sure enough  Now for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime and that must be because they use them mercifully as a tenderhearted old lady uses her rolypoly old coachhorses  But Ahab oh hes a hard driver  Look driven one leg to death and spavined the other for life and now wears out bone legs by the cord Halloa there you Smut bear a hand there with those screws and lets finish it before the resurrection fellow comes acalling with his horn for all legs true or false as brewerymen go round collecting old beer barrels to fill em up again  What a leg this is  It looks like a real live leg filed down to nothing but the core hell be standing on this tomorrow hell be taking altitudes on it  Halloa  I almost forgot the little oval slate smoothed ivory where he figures up the latitude  So so chisel file and sandpaper now CHAPTER 109  Ahab and Starbuck in the CabinAccording to usage they were pumping the ship next morning and lo no inconsiderable oil came up with the water the casks below must have sprung a bad leak  Much concern was shown and Starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affairIn Spermwhalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench the casks with seawater which afterwards at varying intervals is removed by the ships pumps  Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight while by the changed character of the withdrawn water the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargoNow from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and the Bashee Isles between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the China waters into the Pacific  And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islandsNiphon Matsmai and Sikoke  With his snowwhite new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long pruninghook of a jackknife in his hand the wondrous old man with his back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow and tracing his old courses again  Whos there hearing the footstep at the door but not turning round to it  On deck  Begone  Captain Ahab mistakes it is I  The oil in the hold is leaking sir  We must up Burtons and break out  Up Burtons and break out  Now that we are nearing Japan heaveto here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops  Either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year  What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving sir  So it is so it is if we get it  I was speaking of the oil in the hold sir  And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all  Begone  Let it leak  Im all aleak myself  Aye leaks in leaks not only full of leaky casks but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship and thats a far worse plight than the Pequods man  Yet I dont stop to plug my leak for who can find it in the deeploaded hull or how hope to plug it even if found in this lifes howling gale  Starbuck Ill not have the Burtons hoisted  What will the owners say sir  Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons What cares Ahab  Owners owners  Thou art always prating to me Starbuck about those miserly owners as if the owners were my conscience  But look ye the only real owner of anything is its commander and hark ye my conscience is in this ships keelOn deck  Captain Ahab said the reddening mate moving further into the cabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man aye and in a happier Captain Ahab  Devils  Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of meOn deck  Nay sir not yet I do entreat  And I do dare sirto be forbearing  Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto Captain Ahab  Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of most SouthSeamens cabin furniture and pointing it towards Starbuck exclaimed There is one God that is Lord over the earth and one Captain that is lord over the PequodOn deck  For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate and his fiery cheeks you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube  But mastering his emotion he half calmly rose and as he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said Thou hast outraged not insulted me sir but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let Ahab beware of Ahab beware of thyself old man  He waxes brave but nevertheless obeys most careful bravery that murmured Ahab as Starbuck disappeared  Whats that he saidAhab beware of Ahabtheres something there  Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed and returning the gun to the rack he went to the deck  Thou art but too good a fellow Starbuck he said lowly to the mate then raising his voice to the crew Furl the tgallantsails and closereef the topsails fore and aft back the mainyard up Burton and break out in the mainhold  It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was that as respecting Starbuck Ahab thus acted  It may have been a flash of honesty in him or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection however transient in the important chief officer of his ship  However it was his orders were executed and the Burtons were hoisted CHAPTER 110  Queequeg in His CoffinUpon searching it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound and that the leak must be further off  So it being calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing the slumbers of the huge groundtier butts and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above  So deep did they go and so ancient and corroded and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons that you almost looked next for some mouldy cornerstone cask containing coins of Captain Noah with copies of the posted placards vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood  Tierce after tierce too of water and bread and beef and shooks of staves and iron bundles of hoops were hoisted out till at last the piled decks were hard to get about and the hollow hull echoed under foot as if you were treading over empty catacombs and reeled and rolled in the sea like an airfreighted demijohn Topheavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head  Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then  Now at this time it was that my poor pagan companion and fast bosomfriend Queequeg was seized with a fever which brought him nigh to his endless end  Be it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecures are unknown dignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be Captain the higher you rise the harder you toil  So with poor Queequeg who as harpooneer must not only face all the rage of the living whale butas we have elsewhere seenmount his dead back in a rolling sea and finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage  To be short among whalemen the harpooneers are the holders so called  Poor Queequeg when the ship was about half disembowelled you should have stooped over the hatchway and peered down upon him there where stripped to his woollen drawers the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well  And a well or an icehouse it somehow proved to him poor pagan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweatings he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last after some days suffering laid him in his hammock close to the very sill of the door of death  How he wasted and wasted away in those few longlingering days till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing  But as all else in him thinned and his cheekbones grew sharper his eyes nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened  And like circles on the water which as they grow fainter expand so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding like the rings of Eternity  An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage and saw as strange things in his face as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died  For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man never yet was put into words or books And the drawing near of Death which alike levels all alike impresses all with a last revelation which only an author from the dead could adequately tell  So thatlet us say it againno dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest and the oceans invisible floodtide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven  Not a man of the crew but gave him up and as for Queequeg himself what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked  He called one to him in the grey morning watch when the day was just breaking and taking his hand said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood like the rich warwood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket were laid in those same dark canoes and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him for it was not unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming a dead warrior stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes for not only do they believe that the stars are isles but that far beyond all visible horizons their own mild uncontinented seas interflow with the blue heavens and so form the white breakers of the milky way  He added that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual seacustom tossed like something vile to the deathdevouring sharks  No he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket all the more congenial to him being a whaleman that like a whaleboat these coffincanoes were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and much leeway adown the dim ages  Now when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequegs bidding whatever it might include  There was some heathenish coffincoloured old lumber aboard which upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made  No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequegs measure with great accuracy regularly chalking Queequegs person as he shifted the rule  Ah poor fellow hell have to die now ejaculated the Long Island sailor  Going to his vicebench the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities  This done he marshalled the planks and his tools and to work  When the last nail was driven and the lid duly planed and fitted he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction  Overhearing the indignant but halfhumorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away Queequeg to every ones consternation commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him nor was there any denying him seeing that of all mortals some dying men are the most tyrannical and certainly since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore the poor fellows ought to be indulged  Leaning over in his hammock Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye  He then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat  All by his own request also biscuits were then ranged round the sides within a flask of fresh water was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sailcloth being rolled up for a pillow Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed that he might make trial of its comforts if any it had He lay without moving a few minutes then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god Yojo  Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between he called for the coffin lid hatch he called it to be placed over him  The head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view  Rarmai it will do it is easy he murmured at last and signed to be replaced in his hammock  But ere this was done Pip who had been slily hovering near by all this while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sobbings took him by the hand in the other holding his tambourine  Poor rover will ye never have done with all this weary roving where go ye now  But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches are only beat with waterlilies will ye do one little errand for me  Seek out one Pip whos now been missing long I think hes in those far Antilles  If ye find him then comfort him for he must be very sad for look hes left his tambourine behindI found it  Rigadig dig dig  Now Queequeg die and Ill beat ye your dying march  I have heard murmured Starbuck gazing down the scuttle that in violent fevers men all ignorance have talked in ancient tongues and that when the mystery is probed it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars  So to my fond faith poor Pip in this strange sweetness of his lunacy brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes  Where learned he that but thereHark he speaks again but more wildly now  Form two and two  Lets make a General of him  Ho wheres his harpoon  Lay it across hereRigadig dig dig huzza  Oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow  Queequeg dies gamemind ye that Queequeg dies gametake ye good heed of that Queequeg dies game  I say game game game but base little Pip he died a coward died all ashiverout upon Pip  Hark ye if ye find Pip tell all the Antilles hes a runaway a coward a coward a coward  Tell them he jumped from a whaleboat  Id never beat my tambourine over base Pip and hail him General if he were once more dying here  No no shame upon all cowardsshame upon them  Let em go drown like Pip that jumped from a whaleboat  Shame shame  During all this Queequeg lay with closed eyes as if in a dream Pip was led away and the sick man was replaced in his hammock  But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death now that his coffin was proved a good fit Queequeg suddenly rallied soon there seemed no need of the carpenters box and thereupon when some expressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the cause of his sudden convalescence was thisat a critical moment he had just recalled a little duty ashore which he was leaving undone and therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yet he averred  They asked him then whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure  He answered certainly  In a word it was Queequegs conceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale or some violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort  Now there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized that while a sick civilized man may be six months convalescing generally speaking a sick savage is almost halfwell again in a day  So in good time my Queequeg gained strength and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out his arms and legs gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit for a fight  With a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a seachest and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there Many spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings and it seemed that hereby he was striving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body  And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic marks had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but whose mysteries not even himself could read though his own live heart beat against them and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed and so be unsolved to the last  And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his when one morning turning away from surveying poor QueequegOh devilish tantalization of the gods CHAPTER 111  The PacificWhen gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea were it not for other things I could have greeted my dear Pacific with uncounted thanks for now the long supplication of my youth was answered that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue  There is one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St John  And meet it is that over these seapastures widerolling watery prairies and Potters Fields of all four continents the waves should rise and fall and ebb and flow unceasingly for here millions of mixed shades and shadows drowned dreams somnambulisms reveries all that we call lives and souls lie dreaming dreaming still tossing like slumberers in their beds the everrolling waves but made so by their restlessness  To any meditative Magian rover this serene Pacific once beheld must ever after be the sea of his adoption  It rolls the midmost waters of the world the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms  The same waves wash the moles of the newbuilt Californian towns but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands older than Abraham while all between float milkyways of coral isles and lowlying endless unknown Archipelagoes and impenetrable Japans Thus this mysterious divine Pacific zones the worlds whole bulk about makes all coasts one bay to it seems the tidebeating heart of earth  Lifted by those eternal swells you needs must own the seductive god bowing your head to Pan  But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahabs brain as standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming Launched at length upon these almost final waters and gliding towards the Japanese cruisingground the old mans purpose intensified itself  His firm lips met like the lips of a vice the Delta of his foreheads veins swelled like overladen brooks in his very sleep his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull Stern all the White Whale spouts thick blood CHAPTER 112  The BlacksmithAvailing himself of the mild summercool weather that now reigned in these latitudes and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated Perth the begrimed blistered old blacksmith had not removed his portable forge to the hold again after concluding his contributory work for Ahabs leg but still retained it on deck fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen and harpooneers and bowsmen to do some little job for them altering or repairing or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture  Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle all waiting to be served holding boatspades pikeheads harpoons and lances and jealously watching his every sooty movement as he toiled  Nevertheless this old mans was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm  No murmur no impatience no petulance did come from him  Silent slow and solemn bowing over still further his chronically broken back he toiled away as if toil were life itself and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart  And so it wasMost miserable  A peculiar walk in this old man a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners  And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate  Belated and not innocently one bitter winters midnight on the road running between two country towns the blacksmith halfstupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him and sought refuge in a leaning dilapidated barn  The issue was the loss of the extremities of both feet  Out of this revelation part by part at last came out the four acts of the gladness and the one long and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his lifes drama  He was an old man who at the age of nearly sixty had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrows technicals called ruin  He had been an artisan of famed excellence and with plenty to do owned a house and garden embraced a youthful daughterlike loving wife and three blithe ruddy children every Sunday went to a cheerfullooking church planted in a grove  But one night under cover of darkness and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement a desperate burglar slid into his happy home and robbed them all of everything  And darker yet to tell the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his familys heart  It was the Bottle Conjuror  Upon the opening of that fatal cork forth flew the fiend and shrivelled up his home Now for prudent most wise and economic reasons the blacksmiths shop was in the basement of his dwelling but with a separate entrance to it so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness but with vigorous pleasure to the stout ringing of her youngarmed old husbands hammer whose reverberations muffled by passing through the floors and walls came up to her not unsweetly in her nursery and so to stout Labors iron lullaby the blacksmiths infants were rocked to slumber  Oh woe on woe  Oh Death why canst thou not sometimes be timely Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him then had the young widow had a delicious grief and her orphans a truly venerable legendary sire to dream of in their after years and all of them a carekilling competency  But Death plucked down some virtuous elder brother on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family and left the worse than useless old man standing till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest  Why tell the whole  The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between and each blow every day grew fainter than the last the wife sat frozen at the window with tearless eyes glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children the bellows fell the forge choked up with cinders the house was sold the mother dived down into the long churchyard grass her children twice followed her thither and the houseless familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape his every woe unreverenced his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls  Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this but Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote the Wild the Watery the Unshored therefore to the deathlonging eyes of such men who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide does the allcontributed and allreceptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable taking terrors and wonderful newlife adventures and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics the thousand mermaids sing to themCome hither brokenhearted here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death here are wonders supernatural without dying for them  Come hither bury thyself in a life which to your now equally abhorred and abhorring landed world is more oblivious than death  Come hither put up THY gravestone too within the churchyard and come hither till we marry thee  Hearkening to these voices East and West by early sunrise and by fall of eve the blacksmiths soul responded Aye I come  And so Perth went awhaling CHAPTER 113  The ForgeWith matted beard and swathed in a bristling sharkskin apron about midday Perth was standing between his forge and anvil the latter placed upon an ironwood log with one hand holding a pikehead in the coals and with the other at his forges lungs when Captain Ahab came along carrying in his hand a small rustylooking leathern bag While yet a little distance from the forge moody Ahab paused till at last Perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the anvilthe red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights some of which flew close to Ahab  Are these thy Mother Careys chickens Perth they are always flying in thy wake birds of good omen too but not to alllook here they burn but thouthou livst among them without a scorch  Because I am scorched all over Captain Ahab answered Perth resting for a moment on his hammer I am past scorching not easily canst thou scorch a scar  Well well no more  Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly sanely woeful to me  In no Paradise myself I am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad  Thou shouldst go mad blacksmith say why dost thou not go mad  How canst thou endure without being mad  Do the heavens yet hate thee that thou canst not go madWhat wert thou making there  Welding an old pikehead sir there were seams and dents in it  And canst thou make it all smooth again blacksmith after such hard usage as it had  I think so sir  And I suppose thou canst smoothe almost any seams and dents never mind how hard the metal blacksmith  Aye sir I think I can all seams and dents but one  Look ye here then cried Ahab passionately advancing and leaning with both hands on Perths shoulders look ye hereHEREcan ye smoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow if thou couldst blacksmith glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes  Answer  Canst thou smoothe this seam  Oh that is the one sir  Said I not all seams and dents but one  Aye blacksmith it is the one aye man it is unsmoothable for though thou only seest it here in my flesh it has worked down into the bone of my skullTHAT is all wrinkles  But away with childs play no more gaffs and pikes today  Look ye here jingling the leathern bag as if it were full of gold coins  I too want a harpoon made one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part Perth something that will stick in a whale like his own finbone Theres the stuff flinging the pouch upon the anvil  Look ye blacksmith these are the gathered nailstubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses  Horseshoe stubbs sir  Why Captain Ahab thou hast here then the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work  I know it old man these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers  Quick forge me the harpoon  And forge me first twelve rods for its shank then wind and twist and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a towline  Quick  Ill blow the fire  When at last the twelve rods were made Ahab tried them one by one by spiralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt A flaw rejecting the last one  Work that over again Perth  This done Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one when Ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron  As then with regular gasping hems he hammered on the anvil Perth passing to him the glowing rods one after the other and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame the Parsee passed silently and bowing over his head towards the fire seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil  But as Ahab looked up he slid aside  Whats that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for muttered Stubb looking on from the forecastle  That Parsee smells fire like a fusee and smells of it himself like a hot muskets powderpan  At last the shank in one complete rod received its final heat and as Perth to temper it plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by the scalding steam shot up into Ahabs bent face  Wouldst thou brand me Perth wincing for a moment with the pain have I been but forging my own brandingiron then  Pray God not that yet I fear something Captain Ahab  Is not this harpoon for the White Whale  For the white fiend  But now for the barbs thou must make them thyself man  Here are my razorsthe best of steel here and make the barbs sharp as the needlesleet of the Icy Sea  For a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them  Take them man I have no need for them for I now neither shave sup nor pray tillbut hereto work  Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by Perth to the shank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat prior to tempering them he cried to Ahab to place the watercask near  No nono water for that I want it of the true deathtemper Ahoy there  Tashtego Queequeg Daggoo  What say ye pagans  Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb holding it high up  A cluster of dark nods replied Yes  Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh and the White Whales barbs were then tempered  Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli deliriously howled Ahab as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood  Now mustering the spare poles from below and selecting one of hickory with the bark still investing it Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron  A coil of new towline was then unwound and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension  Pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harpstring then eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings Ahab exclaimed Good and now for the seizings  At one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole was then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope was traced halfway along the poles length and firmly secured so with intertwistings of twine  This done pole iron and ropelike the Three Fatesremained inseparable and Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole both hollowly ringing along every plank But ere he entered his cabin light unnatural halfbantering yet most piteous sound was heard  Oh Pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship and mocked it CHAPTER 114  The GilderPenetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery Often in mild pleasant weather for twelve fifteen eighteen and twenty hours on the stretch they were engaged in the boats steadily pulling or sailing or paddling after the whales or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising though with but small success for their pains  At such times under an abated sun afloat all day upon smooth slow heaving swells seated in his boat light as a birch canoe and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves that like hearthstone cats they purr against the gunwale these are the times of dreamy quietude when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the oceans skin one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it and would not willingly remember that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang  These are the times when in his whaleboat the rover softly feels a certain filial confident landlike feeling towards the sea that he regards it as so much flowery earth and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts seems struggling forward not through high rolling waves but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie as when the western emigrants horses only show their erected ears while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure  The longdrawn virgin vales the mild blue hillsides as over these there steals the hush the hum you almost swear that playwearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes in some glad Maytime when the flowers of the woods are plucked  And all this mixes with your most mystic mood so that fact and fancy halfway meeting interpenetrate and form one seamless whole  Nor did such soothing scenes however temporary fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab  But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing  Oh grassy glades oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul in yethough long parched by the dead drought of the earthy lifein ye men yet may roll like young horses in new morning clover and for some few fleeting moments feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them  Would to God these blessed calms would last But the mingled mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof calms crossed by storms a storm for every calm  There is no steady unretracing progress in this life we do not advance through fixed gradations and at the last one pausethrough infancys unconscious spell boyhoods thoughtless faith adolescence doubt the common doom then scepticism then disbelief resting at last in manhoods pondering repose of If  But once gone through we trace the round again and are infants boys and men and Ifs eternally  Where lies the final harbor whence we unmoor no more  In what rapt ether sails the world of which the weariest will never weary  Where is the foundlings father hidden  Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them the secret of our paternity lies in their grave and we must there to learn it  And that same day too gazing far down from his boats side into that same golden sea Starbuck lowly murmured  Loveliness unfathomable as ever lover saw in his young brides eyeTell me not of thy teethtiered sharks and thy kidnapping cannibal ways  Let faith oust fact let fancy oust memory I look deep down and do believe  And Stubb fishlike with sparkling scales leaped up in that same golden light  I am Stubb and Stubb has his history but here Stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly CHAPTER 115  The Pequod Meets The BachelorAnd jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind some few weeks after Ahabs harpoon had been welded  It was a Nantucket ship the Bachelor which had just wedged in her last cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatches and now in glad holiday apparel was joyously though somewhat vaingloriously sailing round among the widelyseparated ships on the ground previous to pointing her prow for home  The three men at her masthead wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats from the stern a whaleboat was suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain  Signals ensigns and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging on every side Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm above which in her topmast crosstrees you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp  As was afterwards learned the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish  Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for from the ships she had met and these were stowed along the deck and in the captains and officers staterooms  Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindlingwood and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oilbutt lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece  In the forecastle the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests and filled them it was humorously added that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler and filled it that the steward had plugged his spare coffeepot and filled it that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them that indeed everything was filled with sperm except the captains pantaloons pockets and those he reserved to thrust his hands into in selfcomplacent testimony of his entire satisfaction  As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge trypots which covered with the parchmentlike POKE or stomach skin of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew  On the quarterdeck the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olivehued girls who had eloped with them from the Polynesian Isles while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast three Long Island negroes with glittering fiddlebows of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious jig  Meanwhile others of the ships company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the tryworks from which the huge pots had been removed  You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille such wild cries they raised as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea  Lord and master over all this scene the captain stood erect on the ships elevated quarterdeck so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion  And Ahab he too was standing on his quarterdeck shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each others wakesone all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodings as to things to cometheir two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene  Come aboard come aboard cried the gay Bachelors commander lifting a glass and a bottle in the air  Hast seen the White Whale gritted Ahab in reply  No only heard of him but dont believe in him at all said the other goodhumoredly  Come aboard  Thou art too damned jolly  Sail on  Hast lost any men  Not enough to speak oftwo islanders thats allbut come aboard old hearty come along  Ill soon take that black from your brow Come along will ye merrys the play a full ship and homewardbound  How wondrous familiar is a fool muttered Ahab then aloud Thou art a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well then call me an empty ship and outwardbound  So go thy ways and I will mine Forward there  Set all sail and keep her to the wind  And thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other stubbornly fought against it and so the two vessels parted the crew of the Pequod looking with grave lingering glances towards the receding Bachelor but the Bachelors men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in  And as Ahab leaning over the taffrail eyed the homewardbound craft he took from his pocket a small vial of sand and then looking from the ship to the vial seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings CHAPTER 116  The Dying WhaleNot seldom in this life when on the right side fortunes favourites sail close by us we though all adroop before catch somewhat of the rushing breeze and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out  So seemed it with the Pequod  For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by Ahab  It was far down the afternoon and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun and whale both stilly died together then such a sweetness and such plaintiveness such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles the Spanish landbreeze wantonly turned sailor had gone to sea freighted with these vesper hymns  Soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom Ahab who had sterned off from the whale sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat  For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dyingthe turning sunwards of the head and so expiringthat strange spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before  He turns and turns him to ithow slowly but how steadfastly his homagerendering and invoking brow with his last dying motions  He too worships fire most faithful broad baronial vassal of the sunOh that these toofavouring eyes should see these toofavouring sights  Look here far waterlocked beyond all hum of human weal or woe in these most candid and impartial seas where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets where for long Chinese ages the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to as stars that shine upon the Nigers unknown source here too life dies sunwards full of faith but see no sooner dead than death whirls round the corpse and it heads some other way  Oh thou dark Hindoo half of nature who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas thou art an infidel thou queen and too truly speakest to me in the wideslaughtering Typhoon and the hushed burial of its after calm  Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head and then gone round again without a lesson to me  Oh trebly hooped and welded hip of power  Oh high aspiring rainbowed jetthat one strivest this one jettest all in vain  In vain oh whale dost thou seek intercedings with yon allquickening sun that only calls forth life but gives it not again  Yet dost thou darker half rock me with a prouder if a darker faith  All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here I am buoyed by breaths of once living things exhaled as air but water now  Then hail for ever hail O sea in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds his only rest  Born of earth yet suckled by the sea though hill and valley mothered me ye billows are my fosterbrothers CHAPTER 117  The Whale WatchThe four whales slain that evening had died wide apart one far to windward one less distant to leeward one ahead one astern These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but the windward one could not be reached till morning and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night and that boat was Ahabs  The waifpole was thrust upright into the dead whales spouthole and the lantern hanging from its top cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight waves which gently chafed the whales broad flank like soft surf upon a beach  Ahab and all his boats crew seemed asleep but the Parsee who crouching in the bow sat watching the sharks that spectrally played round the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah ran shuddering through the air  Started from his slumbers Ahab face to face saw the Parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world  I have dreamed it again said he  Of the hearses  Have I not said old man that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine  And who are hearsed that die on the sea  But I said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first not made by mortal hands and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America  Aye aye a strange sight that Parseea hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for the pallbearers  Ha Such a sight we shall not soon see  Believe it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old man  And what was that saying about thyself  Though it come to the last I shall still go before thee thy pilot  And when thou art so gone beforeif that ever befallthen ere I can follow thou must still appear to me to pilot me stillWas it not so  Well then did I believe all ye say oh my pilot  I have here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it  Take another pledge old man said the Parsee as his eyes lighted up like fireflies in the gloomHemp only can kill thee  The gallows ye meanI am immortal then on land and on sea cried Ahab with a laugh of derisionImmortal on land and on sea  Both were silent again as one man  The grey dawn came on and the slumbering crew arose from the boats bottom and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship CHAPTER 118  The QuadrantThe season for the Line at length drew near and every day when Ahab coming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ships prow for the equator  In good time the order came It was hard upon high noon and Ahab seated in the bows of his highhoisted boat was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude  Now in that Japanese sea the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences  That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy oceans immeasurable burningglass  The sky looks lacquered clouds there are none the horizon floats and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of Gods throne  Well that Ahabs quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses through which to take sight of that solar fire  So swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship and with his astrologicallooking instrument placed to his eye he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian  Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ships deck and with face thrown up like Ahabs was eyeing the same sun with him only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness  At length the desired observation was taken and with his pencil upon his ivory leg Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant  Then falling into a moments revery he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself Thou seamark thou high and mighty Pilot thou tellest me truly where I AMbut canst thou cast the least hint where I SHALL be  Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living  Where is Moby Dick This instant thou must be eyeing him  These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him aye and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun  Then gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other its numerous cabalistical contrivances he pondered again and muttered Foolish toy babies plaything of haughty Admirals and Commodores and Captains the world brags of thee of thy cunning and might but what after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet and the hand that holds thee no not one jot more  Thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be tomorrow noon and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun  Science  Curse thee thou vain toy and cursed be all the things that cast mans eyes aloft to that heaven whose live vividness but scorches him as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light O sun  Level by nature to this earths horizon are the glances of mans eyes not shot from the crown of his head as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament Curse thee thou quadrant dashing it to the deck no longer will I guide my earthly way by thee the level ships compass and the level deadreckoning by log and by line THESE shall conduct me and show me my place on the sea  Aye lighting from the boat to the deck thus I trample on thee thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high thus I split and destroy thee  As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himselfthese passed over the mute motionless Parsees face  Unobserved he rose and glided away while awestruck by the aspect of their commander the seamen clustered together on the forecastle till Ahab troubledly pacing the deck shouted outTo the braces  Up helmsquare in  In an instant the yards swung round and as the ship halfwheeled upon her heel her three firmseated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long ribbed hull seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed  Standing between the knightheads Starbuck watched the Pequods tumultuous way and Ahabs also as he went lurching along the deck  I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow full of its tormented flaming life and I have seen it wane at last down down to dumbest dust  Old man of oceans of all this fiery life of thine what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes  Aye cried Stubb but seacoal ashesmind ye that Mr Starbuckseacoal not your common charcoal  Well well I heard Ahab mutter Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine swears that I must play them and no others  And damn me Ahab but thou actest right live in the game and die in it CHAPTER 119  The CandlesWarmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs the tiger of Bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure  Skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands  So too it is that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms the Typhoon  It will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town  Towards evening of that day the Pequod was torn of her canvas and barepoled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly ahead  When darkness came on sky and sea roared and split with the thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport  Holding by a shroud Starbuck was standing on the quarterdeck at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there while Stubb and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats  But all their pains seemed naught  Though lifted to the very top of the cranes the windward quarter boat Ahabs did not escape  A great rolling sea dashing high up against the reeling ships high teetering side stove in the boats bottom at the stern and left it again all dripping through like a sieve  Bad work bad work  Mr Starbuck said Stubb regarding the wreck but the sea will have its way  Stubb for one cant fight it  You see Mr Starbuck a wave has such a great long start before it leaps all round the world it runs and then comes the spring  But as for me all the start I have to meet it is just across the deck here  But never mind its all in fun so the old song saysSINGS  Oh jolly is the gale And a joker is the whale A flourishin his tail Such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hokypoky lad is the Ocean oh  The scud all a flyin Thats his flip only foamin When he stirs in the spicin Such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hokypoky lad is the Ocean oh  Thunder splits the ships But he only smacks his lips A tastin of this flip Such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hokypoky lad is the Ocean ohAvast Stubb cried Starbuck let the Typhoon sing and strike his harp here in our rigging but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace  But I am not a brave man never said I was a brave man I am a coward and I sing to keep up my spirits  And I tell you what it is Mr Starbuck theres no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat  And when thats done ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a windup  Madman look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own  What how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else never mind how foolish  Here cried Starbuck seizing Stubb by the shoulder and pointing his hand towards the weather bow markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove  In the sternsheets man where he is wont to standhis standpoint is stove man  Now jump overboard and sing away if thou must  I dont half understand ye whats in the wind  Yes yes round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket soliloquized Starbuck suddenly heedless of Stubbs question  The gale that now hammers at us to stave us we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home  Yonder to windward all is blackness of doom but to leeward homewardI see it lightens up there but not with the lightning  At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness following the flashes a voice was heard at his side and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead  Whos there  Old Thunder said Ahab groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivothole but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire  Now as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water  But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth that its end may avoid all contact with the hull and as moreover if kept constantly towing there it would be liable to many mishaps besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging and more or less impeding the vessels way in the water because of all this the lower parts of a ships lightningrods are not always overboard but are generally made in long slender links so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside or thrown down into the sea as occasion may require  The rods the rods cried Starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux to light Ahab to his post  Are they overboard drop them over fore and aft  Quick  Avast cried Ahab lets have fair play here though we be the weaker side  Yet Ill contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes that all the world may be secured but out on privileges  Let them be sir  Look aloft cried Starbuck  The corpusants the corpusants  All the yardarms were tipped with a pallid fire and touched at each tripointed lightningrodend with three tapering white flames each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar  Blast the boat let it go cried Stubb at this instant as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft so that its gunwale violently jammed his hand as he was passing a lashing Blast itbut slipping backward on the deck his uplifted eyes caught the flames and immediately shifting his tone he criedThe corpusants have mercy on us all  To sailors oaths are household words they will swear in the trance of the calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate curses from the topsailyardarms when most they teeter over to a seething sea but in all my voyagings seldom have I heard a common oath when Gods burning finger has been laid on the ship when His Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage  While this pallidness was burning aloft few words were heard from the enchanted crew who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence like a far away constellation of stars  Relieved against the ghostly light the gigantic jet negro Daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come  The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his sharkwhite teeth which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by the preternatural light Queequegs tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body  The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall A moment or two passed when Starbuck going forward pushed against some one  It was Stubb  What thinkest thou now man I heard thy cry it was not the same in the song  No no it wasnt I said the corpusants have mercy on us all and I hope they will still  But do they only have mercy on long faceshave they no bowels for a laugh  And look ye Mr Starbuckbut its too dark to look  Hear me then I take that masthead flame we saw for a sign of good luck for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a block with spermoil dye see and so all that sperm will work up into the masts like sap in a tree  Yes our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candlesthats the good promise we saw  At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubbs face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight  Glancing upwards he cried See see and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor  The corpusants have mercy on us all cried Stubb again  At the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the flame the Parsee was kneeling in Ahabs front but with his head bowed away from him while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where they had just been engaged securing a spar a number of the seamen arrested by the glare now cohered together and hung pendulous like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping orchard twig In various enchanted attitudes like the standing or stepping or running skeletons in Herculaneum others remained rooted to the deck but all their eyes upcast  Aye aye men cried Ahab  Look up at it mark it well the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale  Hand me those mainmast links there I would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it blood against fire  So  Then turningthe last link held fast in his left hand he put his foot upon the Parsee and with fixed upward eye and highflung right arm he stood erect before the lofty tripointed trinity of flames  Oh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship till in the sacramental act so burned by thee that to this hour I bear the scar I now know thee thou clear spirit and I now know that thy right worship is defiance  To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind and een for hate thou canst but kill and all are killed  No fearless fool now fronts thee  I own thy speechless placeless power but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional unintegral mastery in me  In the midst of the personified impersonal a personality stands here Though but a point at best whencesoeer I came wheresoeer I go yet while I earthly live the queenly personality lives in me and feels her royal rights  But war is pain and hate is woe  Come in thy lowest form of love and I will kneel and kiss thee but at thy highest come as mere supernal power and though thou launchest navies of fullfreighted worlds theres that in here that still remains indifferent  Oh thou clear spirit of thy fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire I breathe it back to thee  SUDDEN REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING THE NINE FLAMES LEAP LENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT AHAB WITH THE REST CLOSES HIS EYES HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM  I own thy speechless placeless power said I not so  Nor was it wrung from me nor do I now drop these links  Thou canst blind but I can then grope  Thou canst consume but I can then be ashes  Take the homage of these poor eyes and shutterhands  I would not take it  The lightning flashes through my skull mine eyeballs ache and ache my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded and rolling on some stunning ground  Oh oh  Yet blindfold yet will I talk to thee Light though thou be thou leapest out of darkness but I am darkness leaping out of light leaping out of thee  The javelins cease open eyes see or not  There burn the flames  Oh thou magnanimous now I do glory in my genealogy  But thou art but my fiery father my sweet mother I know not  Oh cruel what hast thou done with her There lies my puzzle but thine is greater  Thou knowest not how came ye hence callest thyself unbegotten certainly knowest not thy beginning hence callest thyself unbegun  I know that of me which thou knowest not of thyself oh thou omnipotent  There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee thou clear spirit to whom all thy eternity is but time all thy creativeness mechanical  Through thee thy flaming self my scorched eyes do dimly see it  Oh thou foundling fire thou hermit immemorial thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle thy unparticipated grief  Here again with haughty agony I read my sire  Leap leap up and lick the sky  I leap with thee I burn with thee would fain be welded with thee defyingly I worship thee  The boat the boat cried Starbuck look at thy boat old man  Ahabs harpoon the one forged at Perths fire remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whaleboats bow but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale forked fire  As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpents tongue Starbuck grasped Ahab by the armGod God is against thee old man forbear tis an ill voyage ill begun ill continued let me square the yards while we may old man and make a fair wind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this  Overhearing Starbuck the panicstricken crew instantly ran to the bracesthough not a sail was left aloft  For the moment all the aghast mates thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry  But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck and snatching the burning harpoon Ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a ropes end  Petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dismay and Ahab again spoke  All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine and heart soul and body lungs and life old Ahab is bound  And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats look ye here thus I blow out the last fear  And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame  As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain men fly the neighborhood of some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts so at those last words of Ahabs many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay CHAPTER 120  The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch  AHAB STANDING BY THE HELM  STARBUCK APPROACHING HIMWe must send down the maintopsail yard sir  The band is working loose and the lee lift is halfstranded  Shall I strike it sir  Strike nothing lash it  If I had skysail poles Id sway them up now  Sirin Gods namesir  Well  The anchors are working sir  Shall I get them inboard  Strike nothing and stir nothing but lash everything  The wind rises but it has not got up to my tablelands yet  Quick and see to itBy masts and keels he takes me for the hunchbacked skipper of some coasting smack  Send down my maintopsail yard  Ho gluepots  Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds and this braintruck of mine now sails amid the cloudscud  Shall I strike that  Oh none but cowards send down their braintrucks in tempest time  What a hooroosh aloft there  I would een take it for sublime did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady  Oh take medicine take medicine CHAPTER 121  MidnightThe Forecastle BulwarksSTUBB AND FLASK MOUNTED ON THEM AND PASSING ADDITIONAL LASHINGS OVER THE ANCHORS THERE HANGINGNo Stubb you may pound that knot there as much as you please but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying  And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary  Didnt you once say that whatever ship Ahab sails in that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward  Stop now didnt you say so  Well suppose I did  What then  Ive part changed my flesh since that time why not my mind  Besides supposing we ARE loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here  Why my little man you have pretty red hair but you couldnt get afire now  Shake yourself youre Aquarius or the waterbearer Flask might fill pitchers at your coat collar  Dont you see then that for these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees Here are hydrants Flask  But hark again and Ill answer ye the other thing  First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here though so I can pass the rope now listen  Whats the mighty difference between holding a masts lightningrod in the storm and standing close by a mast that hasnt got any lightningrod at all in a storm  Dont you see you timberhead that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the mast is first struck  What are you talking about then  Not one ship in a hundred carries rods and Ahabaye man and all of uswere in no more danger then in my poor opinion than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas  Why you KingPost you I suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightningrod running up the corner of his hat like a militia officers skewered feather and trailing behind like his sash  Why dont ye be sensible Flask its easy to be sensible why dont ye then any man with half an eye can be sensible  I dont know that Stubb  You sometimes find it rather hard  Yes when a fellows soaked through its hard to be sensible thats a fact  And I am about drenched with this spray  Never mind catch the turn there and pass it  Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again Tying these two anchors here Flask seems like tying a mans hands behind him  And what big generous hands they are to be sure  These are your iron fists hey  What a hold they have too  I wonder Flask whether the world is anchored anywhere if she is she swings with an uncommon long cable though  There hammer that knot down and weve done  So next to touching land lighting on deck is the most satisfactory  I say just wring out my jacket skirts will ye Thank ye  They laugh at longtogs so Flask but seems to me a Long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat  The tails tapering down that way serve to carry off the water dye see Same with cocked hats the cocks form gableend eavetroughs Flask No more monkeyjackets and tarpaulins for me I must mount a swallowtail and drive down a beaver so  Halloa whew there goes my tarpaulin overboard Lord Lord that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly  This is a nasty night lad CHAPTER 122  Midnight AloftThunder and LightningTHE MAINTOPSAIL YARDTASHTEGO PASSING NEW LASHINGS AROUND ITUm um um  Stop that thunder  Plenty too much thunder up here Whats the use of thunder  Um um um  We dont want thunder we want rum give us a glass of rum  Um um um CHAPTER 123  The MusketDuring the most violent shocks of the Typhoon the man at the Pequods jawbone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions even though preventer tackles had been attached to itfor they were slackbecause some play to the tiller was indispensable  In a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses at intervals go round and round  It was thus with the Pequods at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion  Some hours after midnight the Typhoon abated so much that through the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubbone engaged forward and the other aftthe shivered remnants of the jib and fore and maintopsails were cut adrift from the spars and went eddying away to leeward like the feathers of an albatross which sometimes are cast to the winds when that stormtossed bird is on the wing  The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed and a stormtrysail was set further aft so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again and the coursefor the present Eastsoutheastwhich he was to steer if practicable was once more given to the helmsman  For during the violence of the gale he had only steered according to its vicissitudes  But as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible watching the compass meanwhile lo a good sign the wind seemed coming round astern aye the foul breeze became fair  Instantly the yards were squared to the lively song of HO THE FAIR WIND OHYEHO CHEERLY MEN the crew singing for joy that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it  In compliance with the standing order of his commanderto report immediately and at any one of the twentyfour hours any decided change in the affairs of the deckStarbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breezehowever reluctantly and gloomilythan he mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance  Ere knocking at his stateroom he involuntarily paused before it a moment  The cabin lamptaking long swings this way and thatwas burning fitfully and casting fitful shadows upon the old mans bolted doora thin one with fixed blinds inserted in place of upper panels  The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements  The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead  Starbuck was an honest upright man but out of Starbucks heart at that instant when he saw the muskets there strangely evolved an evil thought but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself  He would have shot me once he murmured yes theres the very musket that he pointed at methat one with the studded stock let me touch itlift it  Strange that I who have handled so many deadly lances strange that I should shake so now  Loaded  I must see  Aye aye and powder in the panthats not good  Best spill itwait  Ill cure myself of this  Ill hold the musket boldly while I thinkI come to report a fair wind to him  But how fair Fair for death and doomTHATS fair for Moby Dick  Its a fair wind thats only fair for that accursed fishThe very tube he pointed at methe very one THIS oneI hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing I handle nowAye and he would fain kill all his crew  Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale  Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant and in these same perilous seas gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the errorabounding log and in this very Typhoon did he not swear that he would have no lightningrods  But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ships company down to doom with himYes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if Ahab have his way  If then he were this instantput aside that crime would not be his  Ha is he muttering in his sleep  Yes just therein there hes sleeping Sleeping aye but still alive and soon awake again  I cant withstand thee then old man  Not reasoning not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to all this thou scornest  Flat obedience to thy own flat commands this is all thou breathest  Aye and sayst the men have vowd thy vow sayst all of us are Ahabs Great God forbidBut is there no other way no lawful wayMake him a prisoner to be taken home  What hope to wrest this old mans living power from his own living hands  Only a fool would try it Say he were pinioned even knotted all over with ropes and hawsers chained down to ringbolts on this cabin floor he would be more hideous than a caged tiger then  I could not endure the sight could not possibly fly his howlings all comfort sleep itself inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage What then remains  The land is hundreds of leagues away and locked Japan the nearest  I stand alone here upon an open sea with two oceans and a whole continent between me and lawAye aye tis soIs heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a wouldbe murderer in his bed tindering sheets and skin togetherAnd would I be a murderer then ifand slowly stealthily and half sideways looking he placed the loaded muskets end against the door  On this level Ahabs hammock swings within his head this way  A touch and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child againOh Mary  Maryboy boy boyBut if I wake thee not to death old man who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbucks body this day week may sink with all the crew  Great God where art Thou  Shall I shall IThe wind has gone down and shifted sir the fore and main topsails are reefed and set she heads her course  Stern all  Oh Moby Dick I clutch thy heart at last  Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old mans tormented sleep as if Starbucks voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak  The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkards arm against the panel Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel but turning from the door he placed the deathtube in its rack and left the place  Hes too sound asleep Mr Stubb go thou down and wake him and tell him  I must see to the deck here  Thou knowst what to say CHAPTER 124  The NeedleNext morning the notyetsubsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk and striving in the Pequods gurgling track pushed her on like giants palms outspread  The strong unstaggering breeze abounded so that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails the whole world boomed before the wind  Muffled in the full morning light the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks  Emblazonings as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens reigned over everything The sea was as a crucible of molten gold that bubblingly leaps with light and heat  Long maintaining an enchanted silence Ahab stood apart and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright suns rays produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the suns rearward place and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake  Ha ha my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the seachariot of the sun  Ho ho all ye nations before my prow I bring the sun to ye  Yoke on the further billows hallo a tandem I drive the sea  But suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towards the helm huskily demanding how the ship was heading  Eastsoueast sir said the frightened steersman  Thou liest smiting him with his clenched fist  Heading East at this hour in the morning and the sun astern  Upon this every soul was confounded for the phenomenon just then observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause  Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle Ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost seemed to stagger  Standing behind him Starbuck looked and lo the two compasses pointed East and the Pequod was as infallibly going West  But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed I have it  It has happened before  Mr Starbuck last nights thunder turned our compassesthats all  Thou hast before now heard of such a thing I take it  Aye but never before has it happened to me sir said the pale mate gloomily  Here it must needs be said that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms  The magnetic energy as developed in the mariners needle is as all know essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled at that such things should be  Instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal all its loadstone virtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wifes knitting needle  But in either case the needle never again of itself recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compasses be affected the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson  Deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed compasses the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took the precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted shouted out his orders for the ships course to be changed accordingly  The yards were hard up and once more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her  Meanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts Starbuck said nothing but quietly he issued all requisite orders while Stubb and Flaskwho in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelingslikewise unmurmuringly acquiesced  As for the men though some of them lowly rumbled their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate  But as ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahabs  For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries  But chancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed copper sighttubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck  Thou poor proud heavengazer and suns pilot yesterday I wrecked thee and today the compasses would fain have wrecked me  So so But Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet  Mr Starbucka lance without a pole a topmaul and the smallest of the sailmakers needles  Quick  Accessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do were certain prudential motives whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses Besides the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles though clumsily practicable was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors without some shudderings and evil portents  Men said he steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handed him the things he had demanded my men the thunder turned old Ahabs needles but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own that will point as true as any  Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors as this was said and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow  But Starbuck looked away  With a blow from the topmaul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade him hold it upright without its touching the deck  Then with the maul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered that several times the mate still holding the rod as before  Then going through some small strange motions with itwhether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew is uncertainhe called for linen thread and moving to the binnacle slipped out the two reversed needles there and horizontally suspended the sailneedle by its middle over one of the compasscards  At first the steel went round and round quivering and vibrating at either end but at last it settled to its place when Ahab who had been intently watching for this result stepped frankly back from the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimedLook ye for yourselves if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone  The sun is East and that compass swears it  One after another they peered in for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs and one after another they slunk away  In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph you then saw Ahab in all his fatal pride CHAPTER 125  The Log and LineWhile now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the log and line had but very seldom been in use  Owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determining the vessels place some merchantmen and many whalemen especially when cruising wholly neglect to heave the log though at the same time and frequently more for forms sake than anything else regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship as well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour  It had been thus with the Pequod  The wooden reel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks  Rains and spray had damped it sun and wind had warped it all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly  But heedless of all this his mood seized Ahab as he happened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnet scene and he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line  The ship was sailing plungingly astern the billows rolled in riots  Forward there  Heave the log  Two seamen came  The goldenhued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman Take the reel one of ye Ill heave  They went towards the extreme stern on the ships lee side where the deck with the oblique energy of the wind was now almost dipping into the creamy sidelongrushing sea  The Manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projecting handleends of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so stood with the angular log hanging downwards till Ahab advanced to him  Ahab stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary handcoil to toss overboard when the old Manxman who was intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to speak  Sir I mistrust it this line looks far gone long heat and wet have spoiled it  Twill hold old gentleman  Long heat and wet have they spoiled thee  Thou seemst to hold  Or truer perhaps life holds thee not thou it  I hold the spool sir  But just as my captain says  With these grey hairs of mine tis not worth while disputing specially with a superior wholl neer confess  Whats that  There nows a patched professor in Queen Natures granitefounded College but methinks hes too subservient  Where wert thou born  In the little rocky Isle of Man sir  Excellent  Thoust hit the world by that  I know not sir but I was born there  In the Isle of Man hey  Well the other way its good  Heres a man from Man a man born in once independent Man and now unmanned of Man which is sucked inby what  Up with the reel  The dead blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last  Up with it  So  The log was heaved  The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl  In turn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely  Hold hard  Snap the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon the tugging log was gone  I crush the quadrant the thunder turns the needles and now the mad sea parts the logline  But Ahab can mend all  Haul in here Tahitian reel up Manxman  And look ye let the carpenter make another log and mend thou the line  See to it  There he goes now to him nothings happened but to me the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world  Haul in haul in Tahitian  These lines run whole and whirling out come in broken and dragging slow  Ha Pip come to help eh Pip  Pip whom call ye Pip  Pip jumped from the whaleboat  Pips missing  Lets see now if ye havent fished him up here fisherman It drags hard I guess hes holding on  Jerk him Tahiti  Jerk him off we haul in no cowards here  Ho theres his arm just breaking water  A hatchet a hatchet cut it offwe haul in no cowards here Captain Ahab sir sir heres Pip trying to get on board again  Peace thou crazy loon cried the Manxman seizing him by the arm Away from the quarterdeck  The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser muttered Ahab advancing Hands off from that holiness  Where sayest thou Pip was boy  Astern there sir astern  Lo lo  And who art thou boy  I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes  Oh God that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through  Who art thou boy  Bellboy sir shipscrier ding dong ding  Pip  Pip  Pip  One hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip five feet highlooks cowardlyquickest known by that  Ding dong ding  Whos seen Pip the coward  There can be no hearts above the snowline  Oh ye frozen heavens look down here  Ye did beget this luckless child and have abandoned him ye creative libertines  Here boy Ahabs cabin shall be Pips home henceforth while Ahab lives  Thou touchest my inmost centre boy thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heartstrings  Come lets down  Whats this heres velvet sharkskin intently gazing at Ahabs hand and feeling it  Ah now had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this perhaps he had neer been lost  This seems to me sir as a manrope something that weak souls may hold by  Oh sir let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together the black one with the white for I will not let this go  Oh boy nor will I thee unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here  Come then to my cabin  Lo ye believers in gods all goodness and in man all ill lo you see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man and man though idiotic and knowing not what he does yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude Come  I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand than though I grasped an Emperors  There go two daft ones now muttered the old Manxman  One daft with strength the other daft with weakness  But heres the end of the rotten lineall dripping too  Mend it eh  I think we had best have a new line altogether  Ill see Mr Stubb about it CHAPTER 126  The LifeBuoySteering now southeastward by Ahabs levelled steel and her progress solely determined by Ahabs level log and line the Pequod held on her path towards the Equator  Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonously mild all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene  At last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it were of the Equatorial fishingground and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the watchthen headed by Flaskwas startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthlylike halfarticulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herods murdered Innocentsthat one and all they started from their reveries and for the space of some moments stood or sat or leaned all transfixedly listening like the carved Roman slave while that wild cry remained within hearing  The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled  Yet the grey Manxmanthe oldest mariner of alldeclared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea  Below in his hammock Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he came to the deck it was then recounted to him by Flask not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings  He hollowly laughed and thus explained the wonder  Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or some dams that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail  But this only the more affected some of them because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress but also from the human look of their round heads and semiintelligent faces seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside  In the sea under certain circumstances seals have more than once been mistaken for men  But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning  At sunrise this man went from his hammock to his masthead at the fore and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it was thus with the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he had not been long at his perch when a cry was hearda cry and a rushingand looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and looking down a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea  The lifebuoya long slender caskwas dropped from the stern where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize it and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that it slowly filled and that parched wood also filled at its every pore and the studded ironbound cask followed the sailor to the bottom as if to yield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one  And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the White Whale on the White Whales own peculiar ground that man was swallowed up in the deep  But few perhaps thought of that at the time  Indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at least as a portent for they regarded it not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged  They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before  But again the old Manxman said nay  The lost lifebuoy was now to be replaced Starbuck was directed to see to it but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end whatever that might prove to be therefore they were going to leave the ships stern unprovided with a buoy when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin  A lifebuoy of a coffin cried Starbuck starting  Rather queer that I should say said Stubb  It will make a good enough one said Flask the carpenter here can arrange it easily  Bring it up theres nothing else for it said Starbuck after a melancholy pause  Rig it carpenter do not look at me sothe coffin I mean  Dost thou hear me  Rig it  And shall I nail down the lid sir moving his hand as with a hammer  Aye  And shall I caulk the seams sir moving his hand as with a caulkingiron  Aye  And shall I then pay over the same with pitch sir moving his hand as with a pitchpot  Away what possesses thee to this  Make a lifebuoy of the coffin and no moreMr Stubb Mr Flask come forward with me  He goes off in a huff  The whole he can endure at the parts he baulks  Now I dont like this  I make a leg for Captain Ahab and he wears it like a gentleman but I make a bandbox for Queequeg and he wont put his head into it  Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin  And now Im ordered to make a lifebuoy of it Its like turning an old coat going to bring the flesh on the other side now  I dont like this cobbling sort of businessI dont like it at all its undignified its not my place  Let tinkers brats do tinkerings we are their betters  I like to take in hand none but clean virgin fairandsquare mathematical jobs something that regularly begins at the beginning and is at the middle when midway and comes to an end at the conclusion not a cobblers job thats at an end in the middle and at the beginning at the end  Its the old womans tricks to be giving cobbling jobs  Lord what an affection all old women have for tinkers  I know an old woman of sixtyfive who ran away with a baldheaded young tinker once  And thats the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore when I kept my jobshop in the Vineyard they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me  But heighho there are no caps at sea but snowcaps  Let me see  Nail down the lid caulk the seams pay over the same with pitch batten them down tight and hang it with the snapspring over the ships stern  Were ever such things done before with a coffin  Some superstitious old carpenters now would be tied up in the rigging ere they would do the job  But Im made of knotty Aroostook hemlock I dont budge  Cruppered with a coffin  Sailing about with a graveyard tray  But never mind  We workers in woods make bridalbedsteads and cardtables as well as coffins and hearses  We work by the month or by the job or by the profit not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work unless it be too confounded cobbling and then we stash it if we can  Hem Ill do the job now tenderly  Ill have melets seehow many in the ships company all told  But Ive forgotten  Any way Ill have me thirty separate Turksheaded lifelines each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin  Then if the hull go down therell be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin a sight not seen very often beneath the sun  Come hammer caulkingiron pitchpot and marlingspike  Lets to it CHAPTER 127  The DeckTHE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINETUBS BETWEEN THE VICEBENCH AND THE OPEN HATCHWAY THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS SEAMS THE STRING OF TWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FROCKAHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABINGANGWAY AND HEARS PIP FOLLOWING HIMBack lad I will be with ye again presently  He goes  Not this hand complies with my humor more genially than that boyMiddle aisle of a church  Whats here  Lifebuoy sir  Mr Starbucks orders  Oh look sir  Beware the hatchway  Thank ye man  Thy coffin lies handy to the vault  Sir  The hatchway oh  So it does sir so it does  Art not thou the legmaker  Look did not this stump come from thy shop  I believe it did sir does the ferrule stand sir  Well enough  But art thou not also the undertaker  Aye sir I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg but theyve set me now to turning it into something else  Then tell me art thou not an arrant allgrasping intermeddling monopolising heathenish old scamp to be one day making legs and the next day coffins to clap them in and yet again lifebuoys out of those same coffins  Thou art as unprincipled as the gods and as much of a jackofalltrades  But I do not mean anything sir  I do as I do  The gods again  Hark ye dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin  The Titans they say hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes and the gravedigger in the play sings spade in hand  Dost thou never  Sing sir  Do I sing  Oh Im indifferent enough sir for that but the reason why the gravedigger made music must have been because there was none in his spade sir  But the caulking mallet is full of it  Hark to it  Aye and thats because the lid theres a soundingboard and what in all things makes the soundingboard is thistheres naught beneath  And yet a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same Carpenter  Hast thou ever helped carry a bier and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate going in  Faith sir Ive  Faith  Whats that  Why faith sir its only a sort of exclamationlikethats all sir  Um um go on  I was about to say sir that  Art thou a silkworm  Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself Look at thy bosom  Despatch and get these traps out of sight  He goes aft  That was sudden now but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes  Ive heard that the Isle of Albemarle one of the Gallipagos is cut by the Equator right in the middle  Seems to me some sort of Equator cuts yon old man too right in his middle Hes always under the Linefiery hot I tell ye  Hes looking this waycome oakum quick  Here we go again  This wooden mallet is the cork and Im the professor of musical glassestap tap  AHAB TO HIMSELF  Theres a sight  Theres a sound  The greyheaded woodpecker tapping the hollow tree  Blind and dumb might well be envied now See that thing rests on two linetubs full of towlines  A most malicious wag that fellow  Rattat  So mans seconds tick  Oh how immaterial are all materials  What things real are there but imponderable thoughts  Here nows the very dreaded symbol of grim death by a mere hap made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life  A lifebuoy of a coffin  Does it go further  Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is after all but an immortalitypreserver  Ill think of that  But no  So far gone am I in the dark side of earth that its other side the theoretic bright one seems but uncertain twilight to me  Will ye never have done Carpenter with that accursed sound  I go below let me not see that thing here when I return again  Now then Pip well talk this over I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee CHAPTER 128  The Pequod Meets The RachelNext day a large ship the Rachel was descried bearing directly down upon the Pequod all her spars thickly clustering with men  At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water but as the broadwinged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst and all life fled from the smitten hull  Bad news she brings bad news muttered the old Manxman  But ere her commander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he could hopefully hail Ahabs voice was heard  Hast seen the White Whale  Aye yesterday  Have ye seen a whaleboat adrift  Throttling his joy Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger captain himself having stopped his vessels way was seen descending her side  A few keen pulls and his boathook soon clinched the Pequods mainchains and he sprang to the deck Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew  But no formal salutation was exchanged  Where was henot killednot killed cried Ahab closely advancing  How was it  It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while three of the strangers boats were engaged with a shoal of whales which had led them some four or five miles from the ship and while they were yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water not very far to leeward whereupon the fourth rigged boata reserved onehad been instantly lowered in chase  After a keen sail before the wind this fourth boatthe swiftest keeled of allseemed to have succeeded in fasteningat least as well as the man at the masthead could tell anything about it  In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers as often happens  There was some apprehension but no positive alarm as yet  The recall signals were placed in the rigging darkness came on and forced to pick up her three far to windward boatsere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite directionthe ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight but for the time to increase her distance from it  But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard she crowded all sailstunsail on stunsailafter the missing boat kindling a fire in her trypots for a beacon and every other man aloft on the lookout  But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her and not finding anything had again dashed on again paused and lowered her boats and though she had thus continued doing till daylight yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen  The story told the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the Pequod  He desired that ship to unite with his own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon as it were  I will wager something now whispered Stubb to Flask that some one in that missing boat wore off that Captains best coat mayhap his watchhes so cursed anxious to get it back  Who ever heard of two pious whaleships cruising after one missing whaleboat in the height of the whaling season  See Flask only see how pale he lookspale in the very buttons of his eyeslookit wasnt the coatit must have been the  My boy my own boy is among them  For Gods sakeI beg I conjurehere exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab who thus far had but icily received his petition  For eightandforty hours let me charter your shipI will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for itif there be no other wayfor eightandforty hours onlyonly thatyou must oh you must and you SHALL do this thing  His son cried Stubb oh its his son hes lost  I take back the coat and watchwhat says Ahab  We must save that boy  Hes drowned with the rest on em last night said the old Manx sailor standing behind them I heard all of ye heard their spirits  Now as it shortly turned out what made this incident of the Rachels the more melancholy was the circumstance that not only was one of the Captains sons among the number of the missing boats crew but among the number of the other boats crews at the same time but on the other hand separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase there had been still another son as that for a time the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity which was only solved for him by his chief mates instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whaleship in such emergencies that is when placed between jeopardized but divided boats always to pick up the majority first  But the captain for some unknown constitutional reason had refrained from mentioning all this and not till forced to it by Ahabs iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy a little lad but twelve years old whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketers paternal love had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race  Nor does it unfrequently occur that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them for a protracted three or four years voyage in some other ship than their own so that their first knowledge of a whalemans career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a fathers natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern  Meantime now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab and Ahab still stood like an anvil receiving every shock but without the least quivering of his own  I will not go said the stranger till you say aye to me  Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case  For YOU too have a boy Captain Ahabthough but a child and nestling safely at home nowa child of your old age tooYes yes you relent I see itrun run men now and stand by to square in the yards  Avast cried Ahabtouch not a ropeyarn then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every wordCaptain Gardiner I will not do it Even now I lose time  Goodbye goodbye  God bless ye man and may I forgive myself but I must go  Mr Starbuck look at the binnacle watch and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers then brace forward again and let the ship sail as before  Hurriedly turning with averted face he descended into his cabin leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit  But starting from his enchantment Gardiner silently hurried to the side more fell than stepped into his boat and returned to his ship  Soon the two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strange vessel was in view she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot however small on the sea  This way and that her yards were swung round starboard and larboard she continued to tack now she beat against a head sea and again it pushed her before it while all the while her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men as three tall cherry trees when the boys are cherrying among the boughs  But by her still halting course and winding woeful way you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray still remained without comfort  She was Rachel weeping for her children because they were not CHAPTER 129  The CabinAHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW  Lad lad I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now  The hour is coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him  There is that in thee poor lad which I feel too curing to my malady  Like cures like and for this hunt my malady becomes my most desired health  Do thou abide below here where they shall serve thee as if thou wert the captain  Aye lad thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair another screw to it thou must be  No no no ye have not a whole body sir do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg only tread upon me sir I ask no more so I remain a part of ye  Oh spite of million villains this makes me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of manand a black and crazybut methinks likecureslike applies to him too he grows so sane again  They tell me sir that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip whose drowned bones now show white for all the blackness of his living skin  But I will never desert ye sir as Stubb did him  Sir I must go with ye  If thou speakest thus to me much more Ahabs purpose keels up in him  I tell thee no it cannot be  Oh good master master master  Weep so and I will murder thee have a care for Ahab too is mad Listen and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck and still know that I am there  And now I quit thee  Thy handMet True art thou lad as the circumference to its centre  So God for ever bless thee and if it come to thatGod for ever save thee let what will befall  AHAB GOES PIP STEPS ONE STEP FORWARDHere he this instant stood I stand in his airbut Im alone Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it but hes missing Pip  Pip  Ding dong ding  Whos seen Pip  He must be up here lets try the door  What neither lock nor bolt nor bar and yet theres no opening it  It must be the spell he told me to stay here Aye and told me this screwed chair was mine  Here then Ill seat me against the transom in the ships full middle all her keel and her three masts before me  Here our old sailors say in their black seventyfours great admirals sometimes sit at table and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants  Ha whats this epaulets epaulets the epaulets all come crowding  Pass round the decanters glad to see ye fill up monsieurs  What an odd feeling now when a black boys host to white men with gold lace upon their coatsMonsieurs have ye seen one Pipa little negro lad five feet high hangdog look and cowardly  Jumped from a whaleboat onceseen him  No  Well then fill up again captains and lets drink shame upon all cowards  I name no names  Shame upon them Put one foot upon the table  Shame upon all cowardsHist above there I hear ivoryOh master master  I am indeed downhearted when you walk over me  But here Ill stay though this stern strikes rocks and they bulge through and oysters come to join me CHAPTER 130  The HatAnd now that at the proper time and place after so long and wide a preliminary cruise Ahaball other whaling waters sweptseemed to have chased his foe into an oceanfold to slay him the more securely there now that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dickand now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters whether sinning or sinned against now it was that there lurked a something in the old mans eyes which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see  As the unsetting polar star which through the livelong arctic six months night sustains its piercing steady central gaze so Ahabs purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew  It domineered above them so that all their bodings doubts misgivings fears were fain to hide beneath their souls and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf  In this foreshadowing interval too all humor forced or natural vanished  Stubb no more strove to raise a smile Starbuck no more strove to check one  Alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to finest dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of Ahabs iron soul  Like machines they dumbly moved about the deck ever conscious that the old mans despot eye was on them  But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours when he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that even as Ahabs eyes so awed the crews the inscrutable Parsees glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at times affected it  Such an added gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now such ceaseless shudderings shook him that the men looked dubious at him half uncertain as it seemed whether indeed he were a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen beings body  And that shadow was always hovering there  For not by night even had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber or go below  He would stand still for hours but never sat or leaned his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly sayWe two watchmen never rest  Nor at any time by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck unless Ahab was before them either standing in his pivothole or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limitsthe mainmast and the mizen or else they saw him standing in the cabinscuttlehis living foot advanced upon the deck as if to step his hat slouched heavily over his eyes so that however motionless he stood however the days and nights were added on that he had not swung in his hammock yet hidden beneath that slouching hat they could never tell unerringly whether for all this his eyes were really closed at times or whether he was still intently scanning them no matter though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded nightdamp gathered in beads of dew upon that stonecarved coat and hat  The clothes that the night had wet the next days sunshine dried upon him and so day after day and night after night he went no more beneath the planks whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for  He ate in the same open air that is his two only mealsbreakfast and dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew all gnarled as unearthed roots of trees blown over which still grow idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure  But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck and though the Parsees mystic watch was without intermission as his own yet these two never seemed to speakone man to the otherunless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary  Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain openly and to the awestruck crew they seemed polelike asunder  If by day they chanced to speak one word by night dumb men were both so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange At times for longest hours without a single hail they stood far parted in the starlight Ahab in his scuttle the Parsee by the mainmast but still fixedly gazing upon each other as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance  And yet somehow did Ahabin his own proper self as daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinatesAhab seemed an independent lord the Parsee but his slave  Still again both seemed yoked together and an unseen tyrant driving them the lean shade siding the solid rib  For be this Parsee what he may all rib and keel was solid Ahab  At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice was heard from aftMan the mastheadsand all through the day till after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of the helmsmans bell was heardWhat dye seesharp sharp  But when three or four days had slided by after meeting the childrenseeking Rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crews fidelity at least of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers he seemed to doubt even whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought  But if these suspicions were really his he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them however his actions might seem to hint them  I will have the first sight of the whale myselfhe said  Aye Ahab must have the doubloon and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved block to secure to the mainmast head he received the two ends of the downwardreeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end in order to fasten it at the rail  This done with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon Daggoo Queequeg Tashtego but shunning Fedallah and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate saidTake the rope sirI give it into thy hands Starbuck Then arranging his person in the basket he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last and afterwards stood near it  And thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and milesahead astern this side and thatwithin the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height  When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging which chances to afford no foothold the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these circumstances its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it Because in such a wilderness of running rigging whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck and when the deckends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings it would be but a natural fatality if unprovided with a constant watchman the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea  So Ahabs proceedings in this matter were not unusual the only strange thing about them seemed to be that Starbuck almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decisionone of those too whose faithfulness on the lookout he had seemed to doubt somewhatit was strange that this was the very man he should select for his watchman freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted persons hands  Now the first time Ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten minutes one of those redbilled savage seahawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mastheads of whalemen in these latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings  Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air then spiralized downwards and went eddying again round his head  But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight  Your hat your hat sir suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman who being posted at the mizenmasthead stood directly behind Ahab though somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing them  But already the sable wing was before the old mans eyes the long hooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk darted away with his prize  An eagle flew thrice round Tarquins head removing his cap to replace it and thereupon Tanaquil his wife declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome  But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good  Ahabs hat was never restored the wild hawk flew on and on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot was dimly discerned falling from that vast height into the sea CHAPTER 131  The Pequod Meets The DelightThe intense Pequod sailed on the rolling waves and days went by the lifebuoycoffin still lightly swung and another ship most miserably misnamed the Delight was descried  As she drew nigh all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams called shears which in some whalingships cross the quarterdeck at the height of eight or nine feet serving to carry the spare unrigged or disabled boats  Upon the strangers shears were beheld the shattered white ribs and some few splintered planks of what had once been a whaleboat but you now saw through this wreck as plainly as you see through the peeled halfunhinged and bleaching skeleton of a horse  Hast seen the White Whale  Look replied the hollowcheeked captain from his taffrail and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck  Hast killed him  The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that answered the other sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together  Not forged and snatching Perths levelled iron from the crotch Ahab held it out exclaimingLook ye Nantucketer here in this hand I hold his death  Tempered in blood and tempered by lightning are these barbs and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin where the White Whale most feels his accursed life  Then God keep thee old manseest thou thatpointing to the hammockI bury but one of five stout men who were alive only yesterday but were dead ere night  Only THAT one I bury the rest were buried before they died you sail upon their tomb  Then turning to his crewAre ye ready there place the plank then on the rail and lift the body so thenOh  Godadvancing towards the hammock with uplifted handsmay the resurrection and the life  Brace forward  Up helm cried Ahab like lightning to his men  But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea not so quick indeed but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism  As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight the strange lifebuoy hanging at the Pequods stern came into conspicuous relief  Ha yonder look yonder men cried a foreboding voice in her wake In vain oh ye strangers ye fly our sad burial ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin CHAPTER 132  The SymphonyIt was a clear steelblue day  The firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that allpervading azure only the pensive air was transparently pure and soft with a womans look and the robust and manlike sea heaved with long strong lingering swells as Samsons chest in his sleep  Hither and thither on high glided the snowwhite wings of small unspeckled birds these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air but to and fro in the deeps far down in the bottomless blue rushed mighty leviathans swordfish and sharks and these were the strong troubled murderous thinkings of the masculine sea  But though thus contrasting within the contrast was only in shades and shadows without those two seemed one it was only the sex as it were that distinguished them  Aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom  And at the girdling line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motionmost seen here at the Equatordenoted the fond throbbing trust the loving alarms with which the poor bride gave her bosom away  Tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkles haggardly firm and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glow in the ashes of ruin untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girls forehead of heaven  Oh immortal infancy and innocency of the azure  Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us  Sweet childhood of air and sky how oblivious were ye of old Ahabs closecoiled woe  But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha laughingeyed elves heedlessly gambol around their old sire sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burntout crater of his brain  Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity  But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel for a moment the cankerous thing in his soul  That glad happy air that winsome sky did at last stroke and caress him the stepmother world so long cruelforbiddingnow threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck and did seem to joyously sob over him as if over one that however wilful and erring she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless  From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop  Starbuck saw the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around  Careful not to touch him or be noticed by him he yet drew near to him and stood there  Ahab turned  Starbuck  Sir  Oh Starbuck it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky  On such a dayvery much such a sweetness as thisI struck my first whalea boyharpooneer of eighteen  Fortyfortyforty years agoago  Forty years of continual whaling forty years of privation and peril and stormtime forty years on the pitiless sea for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep  Aye and yes Starbuck out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore  When I think of this life I have led the desolation of solitude it has been the masoned walledtown of a Captains exclusiveness which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country withoutoh weariness heaviness  Guineacoast slavery of solitary commandwhen I think of all this only halfsuspected not so keenly known to me beforeand how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted farefit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soilwhen the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand and broken the worlds fresh bread to my mouldy crustsaway whole oceans away from that young girlwife I wedded past fifty and sailed for Cape Horn the next day leaving but one dent in my marriage pillowwife wiferather a widow with her husband alive Aye I widowed that poor girl when I married her Starbuck and then the madness the frenzy the boiling blood and the smoking brow with which for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously foamingly chased his preymore a demon than a manaye aye what a forty years foolfoolold fool has old Ahab been  Why this strife of the chase why weary and palsy the arm at the oar and the iron and the lance how the richer or better is Ahab now  Behold Oh Starbuck is it not hard that with this weary load I bear one poor leg should have been snatched from under me  Here brush this old hair aside it blinds me that I seem to weep  Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes  But do I look very old so very very old Starbuck  I feel deadly faint bowed and humped as though I were Adam staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise  God  God  Godcrack my heartstave my brainmockery mockery bitter biting mockery of grey hairs have I lived enough joy to wear ye and seem and feel thus intolerably old  Close stand close to me Starbuck let me look into a human eye it is better than to gaze into sea or sky better than to gaze upon God  By the green land by the bright hearthstone this is the magic glass man I see my wife and my child in thine eye  No no stay on board on boardlower not when I do when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick  That hazard shall not be thine  No no not with the far away home I see in that eye  Oh my Captain my Captain noble soul grand old heart after all why should any one give chase to that hated fish  Away with me let us fly these deadly waters let us home  Wife and child too are Starbuckswife and child of his brotherly sisterly playfellow youth even as thine sir are the wife and child of thy loving longing paternal old age  Away let us awaythis instant let me alter the course  How cheerily how hilariously O my Captain would we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again  I think sir they have some such mild blue days even as this in Nantucket  They have they have  I have seen themsome summer days in the morning  About this timeyes it is his noon nap nowthe boy vivaciously wakes sits up in bed and his mother tells him of me of cannibal old me how I am abroad upon the deep but will yet come back to dance him again  Tis my Mary my Mary herself  She promised that my boy every morning should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his fathers sail  Yes yes no more it is done we head for Nantucket  Come my Captain study out the course and let us away See see the boys face from the window the boys hand on the hill  But Ahabs glance was averted like a blighted fruit tree he shook and cast his last cindered apple to the soil  What is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is it what cozening hidden lord and master and cruel remorseless emperor commands me that against all natural lovings and longings I so keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper natural heart I durst not so much as dare  Is Ahab Ahab  Is it I God or who that lifts this arm  But if the great sun move not of himself but is as an errandboy in heaven nor one single star can revolve but by some invisible power how then can this one small heart beat this one small brain think thoughts unless God does that beating does that thinking does that living and not I  By heaven man we are turned round and round in this world like yonder windlass and Fate is the handspike  And all the time lo that smiling sky and this unsounded sea  Look see yon Albicore who put it into him to chase and fang that flyingfish  Where do murderers go man  Whos to doom when the judge himself is dragged to the bar  But it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky and the air smells now as if it blew from a faraway meadow they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes Starbuck and the mowers are sleeping among the newmown hay  Sleeping  Aye toil we how we may we all sleep at last on the field  Sleep  Aye and rust amid greenness as last years scythes flung down and left in the halfcut swathsStarbuck  But blanched to a corpses hue with despair the Mate had stolen away  Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side but started at two reflected fixed eyes in the water there  Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail CHAPTER 133  The ChaseFirst DayThat night in the midwatch when the old manas his wont at intervalsstepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned and went to his pivothole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ships dog will in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle  He declared that a whale must be near Soon that peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale was palpable to all the watch nor was any mariner surprised when after inspecting the compass and then the dogvane and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible Ahab rapidly ordered the ships course to be slightly altered and the sail to be shortened  The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it the polished metalliclike marks of some swift tiderip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream  Man the mastheads  Call all hands  Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands  What dye see cried Ahab flattening his face to the sky  Nothing nothing sir was the sound hailing down in reply  Tgallant sailsstunsails alow and aloft and on both sides  All sail being set he now cast loose the lifeline reserved for swaying him to the main royalmast head and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither when while but two thirds of the way aloft and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the maintopsail and topgallantsail he raised a gulllike cry in the air  There she blowsthere she blows  A hump like a snowhill  It is Moby Dick  Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three lookouts the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing  Ahab had now gained his final perch some feet above the other lookouts Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the topgallantmast so that the Indians head was almost on a level with Ahabs heel  From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air  To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans  And did none of ye see it before cried Ahab hailing the perched men all around him  I saw him almost that same instant sir that Captain Ahab did and I cried out said Tashtego  Not the same instant not the sameno the doubloon is mine Fate reserved the doubloon for me  I only none of ye could have raised the White Whale first  There she blowsthere she blowsthere she blows  There againthere again he cried in longdrawn lingering methodic tones attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whales visible jets  Hes going to sound  In stunsails  Down topgallantsails  Stand by three boats  Mr Starbuck remember stay on board and keep the ship  Helm there  Luff luff a point So steady man steady  There go flukes  No no only black water All ready the boats there  Stand by stand by  Lower me Mr Starbuck lower lowerquick quicker and he slid through the air to the deck  He is heading straight to leeward sir cried Stubb right away from us cannot have seen the ship yet  Be dumb man  Stand by the braces  Hard down the helmbrace up Shiver hershiver herSo well that  Boats boats  Soon all the boats but Starbucks were dropped all the boatsails setall the paddles plying with rippling swiftness shooting to leeward and Ahab heading the onset  A pale deathglimmer lit up Fedallahs sunken eyes a hideous motion gnawed his mouth  Like noiseless nautilus shells their light prows sped through the sea but only slowly they neared the foe  As they neared him the ocean grew still more smooth seemed drawing a carpet over its waves seemed a noonmeadow so serenely it spread  At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing and continually set in a revolving ring of finest fleecy greenish foam  He saw the vast involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond  Before it far out on the soft Turkishrugged waters went the glistening white shadow from his broad milky forehead a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade and behind the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side  But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea alternate with their fitful flight and like to some flagstaff rising from the painted hull of an argosy the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whales back and at intervals one of the cloud of softtoed fowls hovering and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish silently perched and rocked on this pole the long tail feathers streaming like pennons  A gentle joyousnessa mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested the gliding whale  Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns his lovely leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete not Jove not that great majesty Supreme did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam  On each soft sidecoincident with the parted swell that but once leaving him then flowed so wide awayon each bright side the whale shed off enticings  No wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity had ventured to assail it but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes  Yet calm enticing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all who for the first time eye thee no matter how many in that same way thou mayst have bejuggled and destroyed before  And thus through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea among waves whose handclappings were suspended by exceeding rapture Moby Dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw  But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like Virginias Natural Bridge and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air the grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sight  Hoveringly halting and dipping on the wing the white seafowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left  With oars apeak and paddles down the sheets of their sails adrift the three boats now stilly floated awaiting Moby Dicks reappearance  An hour said Ahab standing rooted in his boats stern and he gazed beyond the whales place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward  It was only an instant for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle The breeze now freshened the sea began to swell  The birdsthe birds cried Tashtego  In long Indian file as when herons take wing the white birds were now all flying towards Ahabs boat and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous expectant cries  Their vision was keener than mans Ahab could discover no sign in the sea  But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as it rose till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white glistening teeth floating up from the undiscoverable bottom  It was Moby Dicks open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an opendoored marble tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition  Then calling upon Fedallah to change places with him went forward to the bows and seizing Perths harpoon commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern  Now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis its bow by anticipation was made to face the whales head while yet under water  But as if perceiving this stratagem Moby Dick with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted himself as it were in an instant shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat  Through and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air and one of the teeth caught in a rowlock  The bluish pearlwhite of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahabs head and reached higher than that  In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed and crossed his arms but the tigeryellow crew were tumbling over each others heads to gain the uttermost stern  And now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his body being submerged beneath the boat he could not be darted at from the bows for the bows were almost inside of him as it were and while the other boats involuntarily paused as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand then it was that monomaniac Ahab furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied with all this he seized the long bone with his naked hands and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe  As now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the frail gunwales bent in collapsed and snapped as both jaws like an enormous shears sliding further aft bit the craft completely in twain and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the two floating wrecks  These floated aside the broken ends drooping the crew at the sternwreck clinging to the gunwales and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across  At that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped Ahab the first to perceive the whales intent by the crafty upraising of his head a movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite But only slipping further into the whales mouth and tilting over sideways as it slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of it as he leaned to the push and so he fell flatfaced upon the sea  Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey Moby Dick now lay at a little distance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rosesome twenty or more feet out of the waterthe now rising swells with all their confluent waves dazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air  So in a gale the but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scudThis motion is peculiar to the sperm whale  It receives its designation pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminary upanddown poise of the whalelance in the exercise called pitchpoling previously described  By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling himBut soon resuming his horizontal attitude Moby Dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochuss elephants in the book of Maccabees  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whales insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swimthough he could still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless Ahabs head was seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst  From the boats fragmentary stern Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him the clinging crew at the other drifting end could not succor him more than enough was it for them to look to themselves  For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whales aspect and so planetarily swift the evercontracting circles he made that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them  And though the other boats unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways Ahab and all nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape  With straining eyes then they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre had now become the old mans head  Meantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the ships mast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down upon the scene and was now so nigh that Ahab in the water hailed herSail on thebut that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick and whelmed him for the time  But struggling out of it again and chancing to rise on a towering crest he shoutedSail on the whaleDrive him off  The Pequods prows were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle she effectually parted the white whale from his victim  As he sullenly swam off the boats flew to the rescue  Dragged into Stubbs boat with bloodshot blinded eyes the white brine caking in his wrinkles the long tension of Ahabs bodily strength did crack and helplessly he yielded to his bodys doom for a time lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubbs boat like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants  Far inland nameless wails came from him as desolate sounds from out ravines  But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it  In an instants compass great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler mens whole lives  And so such hearts though summary in each one suffering still if the gods decree it in their lifetime aggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous intensities for even in their pointless centres those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls  The harpoon said Ahab half way rising and draggingly leaning on one bended armis it safe  Aye sir for it was not darted this is it said Stubb showing it  Lay it before meany missing men  One two three four fivethere were five oars sir and here are five men  Thats goodHelp me man I wish to stand  So so I see him there there going to leeward still what a leaping spoutHands off from me  The eternal sap runs up in Ahabs bones again  Set the sail out oars the helm  It is often the case that when a boat is stove its crew being picked up by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase is thus continued with what is called doublebanked oars  It was thus now  But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale for he seemed to have treblebanked his every fin swimming with a velocity which plainly showed that if now under these circumstances pushed on the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged if not a hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such an unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude  The ship itself then as it sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase Accordingly the boats now made for her and were soon swayed up to their cranesthe two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by herand then hoisting everything to her side and stacking her canvas high up and sideways outstretching it with stunsails like the doublejointed wings of an albatross the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of MobyDick  At the well known methodic intervals the whales glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mastheads and when he would be reported as just gone down Ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnaclewatch in hand so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired his voice was heardWhose is the doubloon now  Dye see him and if the reply was No sir straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch  In this way the day wore on Ahab now aloft and motionless anon unrestingly pacing the planks  As he was thus walking uttering no sound except to hail the men aloft or to bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one to a still greater breadththus to and fro pacing beneath his slouched hat at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped upon the quarterdeck and lay there reversed broken bow to shattered stern  At last he paused before it and as in an already overclouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across so over the old mans face there now stole some such added gloom as this  Stubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though to evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in his Captains mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimedThe thistle the ass refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha  What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck  Man man did I not know thee brave as fearless fire and as mechanical I could swear thou wert a poltroon  Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck  Aye sir said Starbuck drawing near tis a solemn sight an omen and an ill one  Omen omenthe dictionary  If the gods think to speak outright to man they will honourably speak outright not shake their heads and give an old wives darkling hintBegone  Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing Starbuck is Stubb reversed and Stubb is Starbuck and ye two are all mankind and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth nor gods nor men his neighbors  Cold coldI shiverHow now  Aloft there  Dye see him  Sing out for every spout though he spout ten times a second  The day was nearly done only the hem of his golden robe was rustling  Soon it was almost dark but the lookout men still remained unset  Cant see the spout now sirtoo darkcried a voice from the air  How heading when last seen  As before sirstraight to leeward  Good he will travel slower now tis night  Down royals and topgallant stunsails Mr Starbuck  We must not run over him before morning hes making a passage now and may heaveto a while Helm there keep her full before the windAloft come downMr Stubb send a fresh hand to the foremast head and see it manned till morningThen advancing towards the doubloon in the mainmastMen this gold is mine for I earned it but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead and then whosoever of ye first raises him upon the day he shall be killed this gold is that mans and if on that day I shall again raise him then ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye  Away nowthe deck is thine sir  And so saying he placed himself half way within the scuttle and slouching his hat stood there till dawn except when at intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on CHAPTER 134  The ChaseSecond DayAt daybreak the three mastheads were punctually manned afresh  Dye see him cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread  See nothing sir  Turn up all hands and make sail he travels faster than I thought forthe topgallant sailsaye they should have been kept on her all night  But no mattertis but resting for the rush  Here be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale continued through day into night and through night into day is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery  For such is the wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried they will under certain given circumstances pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time while out of sight as well as his probable rate of progression during that period  And in these cases somewhat as a pilot when about losing sight of a coast whose general trending he well knows and which he desires shortly to return to again but at some further point like as this pilot stands by his compass and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote unseen headland eventually to be visited so does the fisherman at his compass with the whale for after being chased and diligently marked through several hours of daylight then when night obscures the fish the creatures future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the pilots coast is to him  So that to this hunters wondrous skill the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land  And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace that with watches in their hands men time his rate as doctors that of a babys pulse and lightly say of it the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour even so almost there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep according to the observed humor of his speed and say to themselves so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude  But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end the wind and the sea must be the whalemans allies for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninetythree leagues and a quarter from his port  Inferable from these statements are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales  The ship tore on leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannonball missent becomes a ploughshare and turns up the level field  By salt and hemp cried Stubb but this swift motion of the deck creeps up ones legs and tingles at the heart  This ship and I are two brave fellowsHa ha  Some one take me up and launch me spinewise on the seafor by liveoaks my spines a keel  Ha ha we go the gait that leaves no dust behind  There she blowsshe blowsshe blowsright ahead was now the masthead cry  Aye aye cried Stubb I knew itye cant escapeblow on and split your spout O whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blow your trumpblister your lungsAhab will dam off your blood as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream  And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew  The frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up like old wine worked anew  Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab but they were broken up and on all sides routed as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison  The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls and by the stirring perils of the previous day the rack of the past nights suspense the fixed unfearing blind reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark by all these things their hearts were bowled along  The wind that made great bellies of their sails and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race  They were one man not thirty  For as the one ship that held them all though it was put together of all contrasting thingsoak and maple and pine wood iron and pitch and hempyet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull which shot on its way both balanced and directed by the long central keel even so all the individualities of the crew this mans valor that mans fear guilt and guiltiness all varieties were welded into oneness and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to  The rigging lived  The mastheads like the tops of tall palms were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs  Clinging to a spar with one hand some reached forth the other with impatient wavings others shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight sat far out on the rocking yards all the spars in full bearing of mortals ready and ripe for their fate  Ah how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them  Why sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried Ahab when after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry no more had been heard  Sway me up men ye have been deceived not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way and then disappears  It was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some other thing for the whalespout as the event itself soon proved for hardly had Ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck when he struck the keynote to an orchestra that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles  The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard asmuch nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile aheadMoby Dick bodily burst into view  For not by any calm and indolent spoutings not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching  Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more  In those moments the torn enraged waves he shakes off seem his mane in some cases this breaching is his act of defiance  There she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in his immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmonlike to Heaven  So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raised for the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale  Aye breach your last to the sun Moby Dick cried Ahab thy hour and thy harpoon are at handDown down all of ye but one man at the fore  The boatsstand by  Unmindful of the tedious ropeladders of the shrouds the men like shooting stars slid to the deck by the isolated backstays and halyards while Ahab less dartingly but still rapidly was dropped from his perch  Lower away he cried so soon as he had reached his boata spare one rigged the afternoon previous  Mr Starbuck the ship is thinekeep away from the boats but keep near them  Lower all  As if to strike a quick terror into them by this time being the first assailant himself Moby Dick had turned and was now coming for the three crews  Ahabs boat was central and cheering his men he told them he would take the whale headandheadthat is pull straight up to his foreheada not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such a course excludes the coming onset from the whales sidelong vision  But ere that close limit was gained and while yet all three boats were plain as the ships three masts to his eye the White Whale churning himself into furious speed almost in an instant as it were rushing among the boats with open jaws and a lashing tail offered appalling battle on every side and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made  But skilfully manoeuvred incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field the boats for a while eluded him though at times but by a planks breadth while all the time Ahabs unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds  But at last in his untraceable evolutions the White Whale so crossed and recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little as if to rally for a more tremendous charge  Seizing that opportunity Ahab first paid out more line and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it againhoping that way to disencumber it of some snarlswhen loa sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks  Caught and twistedcorkscrewed in the mazes of the line loose harpoons and lances with all their bristling barbs and points came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahabs boat Only one thing could be done  Seizing the boatknife he critically reached withinthroughand then withoutthe rays of steel dragged in the line beyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice sundering the rope near the chocksdropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea and was all fast again That instant the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines by so doing irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surfbeaten beach and then diving down into the sea disappeared in a boiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch  While the two crews were yet circling in the waters reaching out after the revolving linetubs oars and other floating furniture while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up and while the old mans linenow partingadmitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he couldin that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perilsAhabs yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wiresas arrowlike shooting perpendicularly from the sea the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom and sent it turning over and over into the air till it fell againgunwale downwardsand Ahab and his men struggled out from under it like seals from a seaside cave  The first uprising momentum of the whalemodifying its direction as he struck the surfaceinvoluntarily launched him along it to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made and with his back to it he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin his tail swiftly drew back and came sideways smiting the sea  But soon as if satisfied that his work for that time was done he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean and trailing after him the intertangled lines continued his leeward way at a travellers methodic pace  As before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight again came bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up the floating mariners tubs oars and whatever else could be caught at and safely landed them on her decks  Some sprained shoulders wrists and ankles livid contusions wrenched harpoons and lances inextricable intricacies of rope shattered oars and planks all these were there but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one  As with Fedallah the day before so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boats broken half which afforded a comparatively easy float nor did it so exhaust him as the previous days mishap  But when he was helped to the deck all eyes were fastened upon him as instead of standing by himself he still halfhung upon the shoulder of Starbuck who had thus far been the foremost to assist him  His ivory leg had been snapped off leaving but one short sharp splinter  Aye aye Starbuck tis sweet to lean sometimes be the leaner who he will and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has  The ferrule has not stood sir said the carpenter now coming up I put good work into that leg  But no bones broken sir I hope said Stubb with true concern  Aye and all splintered to pieces Stubbdye see itBut even with a broken bone old Ahab is untouched and I account no living bone of mine one jot more me than this dead one thats lost  Nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being  Can any lead touch yonder floor any mast scrape yonder roofAloft there which way  Dead to leeward sir  Up helm then pile on the sail again ship keepers down the rest of the spare boats and rig themMr Starbuck away and muster the boats crews  Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks sir  Oh oh oh how this splinter gores me now  Accursed fate that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate  Sir  My body man not thee  Give me something for a canethere that shivered lance will do  Muster the men  Surely I have not seen him yet  By heaven it cannot bemissingquick call them all  The old mans hinted thought was true  Upon mustering the company the Parsee was not there  The Parsee cried Stubbhe must have been caught in  The black vomit wrench theerun all of ye above alow cabin forecastlefind himnot gonenot gone  But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was nowhere to be found  Aye sir said Stubbcaught among the tangles of your lineI thought I saw him dragging under  MY line MY line  Gonegone  What means that little wordWhat deathknell rings in it that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry  The harpoon tootoss over the litter theredye see itthe forged iron men the white whalesno no noblistered fool this hand did dart ittis in the fishAloft there  Keep him nailedQuickall hands to the rigging of the boatscollect the oarsharpooneers the irons the ironshoist the royals highera pull on all the sheetshelm there steady steady for your life Ill ten times girdle the unmeasured globe yea and dive straight through it but Ill slay him yet  Great God but for one single instant show thyself cried Starbuck never never wilt thou capture him old manIn Jesus name no more of this thats worse than devils madness  Two days chased twice stove to splinters thy very leg once more snatched from under thee thy evil shadow goneall good angels mobbing thee with warnings what more wouldst thou haveShall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man  Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea  Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world Oh ohImpiety and blasphemy to hunt him more  Starbuck of late Ive felt strangely moved to thee ever since that hour we both sawthou knowst what in one anothers eyes  But in this matter of the whale be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this handa lipless unfeatured blank  Ahab is for ever Ahab man  This whole acts immutably decreed  Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled  Fool  I am the Fates lieutenant I act under orders  Look thou underling that thou obeyest mineStand round me men  Ye see an old man cut down to the stump leaning on a shivered lance propped up on a lonely foot  Tis Ahabhis bodys part but Ahabs souls a centipede that moves upon a hundred legs  I feel strained half stranded as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale and I may look so  But ere I break yell hear me crack and till ye hear THAT know that Ahabs hawser tows his purpose yet  Believe ye men in the things called omens  Then laugh aloud and cry encore  For ere they drown drowning things will twice rise to the surface then rise again to sink for evermore  So with Moby Dicktwo days hes floatedtomorrow will be the third  Aye men hell rise once morebut only to spout his last  Dye feel brave men brave  As fearless fire cried Stubb  And as mechanical muttered Ahab  Then as the men went forward he muttered on The things called omens  And yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck there concerning my broken boat  Oh how valiantly I seek to drive out of others hearts whats clinched so fast in mineThe Parseethe Parseegone gone and he was to go beforebut still was to be seen again ere I could perishHows thatTheres a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judgeslike a hawks beak it pecks my brain  ILL ILL solve it though  When dusk descended the whale was still in sight to leeward  So once more the sail was shortened and everything passed nearly as on the previous night only the sound of hammers and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow  Meantime of the broken keel of Ahabs wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg while still as on the night before slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle his hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial sat due eastward for the earliest sun CHAPTER 135  The ChaseThird DayThe morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh and once more the solitary nightman at the foremasthead was relieved by crowds of the daylight lookouts who dotted every mast and almost every spar  Dye see him cried Ahab but the whale was not yet in sight  In his infallible wake though but follow that wake thats all Helm there steady as thou goest and hast been going  What a lovely day again were it a newmade world and made for a summerhouse to the angels and this morning the first of its throwing open to them a fairer day could not dawn upon that world Heres food for thought had Ahab time to think but Ahab never thinks he only feels feels feels THATS tingling enough for mortal man to thinks audacity  God only has that right and privilege  Thinking is or ought to be a coolness and a calmness and our poor hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much for that  And yet Ive sometimes thought my brain was very calmfrozen calm this old skull cracks so like a glass in which the contents turned to ice and shiver it  And still this hair is growing now this moment growing and heat must breed it but no its like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava  How the wild winds blow it they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to  A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells and wards of hospitals and ventilated them and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces Out upon itits tainted  Were I the wind Id blow no more on such a wicked miserable world  Id crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there  And yet tis a noble and heroic thing the wind who ever conquered it  In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow  Run tilting at it and you but run through it  Ha a coward wind that strikes stark naked men but will not stand to receive a single blow  Even Ahab is a braver thinga nobler thing than THAT Would now the wind but had a body but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man all these things are bodiless but only bodiless as objects not as agents  Theres a most special a most cunning oh a most malicious difference  And yet I say again and swear it now that theres something all glorious and gracious in the wind  These warm Trade Winds at least that in the clear heavens blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous mildness and veer not from their mark however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about uncertain where to go at last  And by the eternal Poles these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on these Trades or something like themsomething so unchangeable and full as strong blow my keeled soul along  To it  Aloft there  What dye see  Nothing sir  Nothing and noon at hand  The doubloon goes abegging  See the sun  Aye aye it must be so  Ive oversailed him  How got the start  Aye hes chasing ME now not I HIMthats bad I might have known it too  Fool the linesthe harpoons hes towing  Aye aye I have run him by last night  About about  Come down all of ye but the regular look outs  Man the braces  Steering as she had done the wind had been somewhat on the Pequods quarter so that now being pointed in the reverse direction the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake  Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw murmured Starbuck to himself as he coiled the newhauled mainbrace upon the rail God keep us but already my bones feel damp within me and from the inside wet my flesh  I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him  Stand by to sway me up cried Ahab advancing to the hempen basket We should meet him soon  Aye aye sir and straightway Starbuck did Ahabs bidding and once more Ahab swung on high  A whole hour now passed goldbeaten out to ages  Time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense  But at last some three points off the weather bow Ahab descried the spout again and instantly from the three mastheads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it  Forehead to forehead I meet thee this third time Moby Dick  On deck therebrace sharper up crowd her into the winds eye  Hes too far off to lower yet Mr Starbuck  The sails shake  Stand over that helmsman with a topmaul  So so he travels fast and I must down  But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea theres time for that  An old old sight and yet somehow so young aye and not changed a wink since I first saw it a boy from the sandhills of Nantucket  The samethe samethe same to Noah as to me  Theres a soft shower to leeward  Such lovely leewardings  They must lead somewhereto something else than common land more palmy than the palms  Leeward the white whale goes that way look to windward then the better if the bitterer quarter  But good bye good bye old masthead  Whats thisgreen aye tiny mosses in these warped cracks  No such green weather stains on Ahabs head  Theres the difference now between mans old age and matters  But aye old mast we both grow old together sound in our hulls though are we not my ship  Aye minus a leg thats all By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way I cant compare with it and Ive known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers  Whats that he said he should still go before me my pilot and yet to be seen again  But where  Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea supposing I descend those endless stairs and all night Ive been sailing from him wherever he did sink to  Aye aye like many more thou toldst direful truth as touching thyself O Parsee but Ahab there thy shot fell short  Goodbye mastheadkeep a good eye upon the whale the while Im gone  Well talk tomorrow nay tonight when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail  He gave the word and still gazing round him was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck  In due time the boats were lowered but as standing in his shallops stern Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved to the matewho held one of the tackleropes on deckand bade him pause  Starbuck  Sir  For the third time my souls ship starts upon this voyage Starbuck  Aye sir thou wilt have it so  Some ships sail from their ports and ever afterwards are missing Starbuck  Truth sir saddest truth  Some men die at ebb tide some at low water some at the full of the floodand I feel now like a billow thats all one crested comb Starbuck  I am oldshake hands with me man  Their hands met their eyes fastened Starbucks tears the glue  Oh my captain my captainnoble heartgo notgo notsee its a brave man that weeps how great the agony of the persuasion then  Lower awaycried Ahab tossing the mates arm from him  Stand by the crew  In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern  The sharks the sharks cried a voice from the low cabinwindow there O master my master come back  But Ahab heard nothing for his own voice was highlifted then and the boat leaped on  Yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when numbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars every time they dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites  It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whaleboats in those swarming seas the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east  But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried and whether it was that Ahabs crew were all such tigeryellow barbarians and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharksa matter sometimes well known to affect themhowever it was they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others  Heart of wrought steel murmured Starbuck gazing over the side and following with his eyes the receding boatcanst thou yet ring boldly to that sightlowering thy keel among ravening sharks and followed by them openmouthed to the chase and this the critical third dayFor when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit be sure the first is the morning the second the noon and the third the evening and the end of that thingbe that end what it may  Oh my God what is this that shoots through me and leaves me so deadly calm yet expectantfixed at the top of a shudder  Future things swim before me as in empty outlines and skeletons all the past is somehow grown dim  Mary girl thou fadest in pale glories behind me boy  I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue  Strangest problems of life seem clearing but clouds sweep betweenIs my journeys end coming  My legs feel faint like his who has footed it all day  Feel thy heartbeats it yet  Stir thyself Starbuckstave it offmove move speak aloudMasthead there  See ye my boys hand on the hillCrazedaloft therekeep thy keenest eye upon the boats mark well the whaleHo againdrive off that hawk see he peckshe tears the vanepointing to the red flag flying at the maintruckHa he soars away with itWheres the old man now seest thou that sight oh Ahabshudder shudder  The boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mastheadsa downward pointed arm Ahab knew that the whale had sounded but intending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence as the headbeat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow  Drive drive in your nails oh ye waves to their uttermost heads drive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin and no hearse can be mineand hemp only can kill me  Ha ha  Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles then quickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice swiftly rising to the surface  A low rumbling sound was heard a subterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with trailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea  Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fell swamping back into the deep  Crushed thirty feet upwards the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale  Give way cried Ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forward to the attack but maddened by yesterdays fresh irons that corroded in him Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven  The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together as head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once more flailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows but leaving Ahabs almost without a scar  While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks and as the whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up  Lashed round and round to the fishs back pinioned in the turns upon turns in which during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him the half torn body of the Parsee was seen his sable raiment frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab  The harpoon dropped from his hand  Befooled befooleddrawing in a long lean breathAye Parsee I see thee againAye and thou goest before and this THIS then is the hearse that thou didst promise  But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word  Where is the second hearse  Away mates to the ship those boats are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to me if not Ahab is enough to dieDown men the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in that thing I harpoon  Ye are not other men but my arms and my legs and so obey meWheres the whale gone down again  But he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward and had almost passed the shipwhich thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him though for the present her headway had been stopped  He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea  Oh  Ahab cried Starbuck not too late is it even now the third day to desist  See  Moby Dick seeks thee not  It is thou thou that madly seekest him  Setting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward by both oars and canvas  And at last when Ahab was sliding by the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish Starbucks face as he leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow him not too swiftly at a judicious interval Glancing upwards he saw Tashtego Queequeg and Daggoo eagerly mounting to the three mastheads while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in repairing them  One after the other through the portholes as he sped he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances  As he saw all this as he heard the hammers in the broken boats far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart  But he rallied  And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the mainmasthead he shouted to Tashtego who had just gained that perch to descend again for another flag and a hammer and nails and so nail it to the mast  Whether fagged by the three days running chase and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the White Whales way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more though indeed the whales last start had not been so long a one as before  And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat and so continually bit at the plying oars that the blades became jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea at almost every dip  Heed them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars  Pull on tis the better rest the sharks jaw than the yielding water  But at every bite sir the thin blades grow smaller and smaller  They will last long enough pull onBut who can tellhe mutteredwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on AhabBut pull on  Aye all alive nowwe near him  The helm take the helm let me passand so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat  At length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging along with the White Whales flank he seemed strangely oblivious of its advanceas the whale sometimes willand Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist which thrown off from the whales spout curled round his great Monadnock hump he was even thus close to him when with body arched back and both arms lengthwise highlifted to the poise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale  As both steel and curse sank to the socket as if sucked into a morass Moby Dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow and without staving a hole in it so suddenly canted the boat over that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea  As it was three of the oarsmenwho foreknew not the precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for its effectsthese were flung out but so fell that in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again and rising to its level on a combing wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the third man helplessly dropping astern but still afloat and swimming  Almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the White Whale darted through the weltering sea  But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air  What breaks in me  Some sinew crackstis whole again oars oars  Burst in upon him  Hearing the tremendous rush of the seacrashing boat the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay but in that evolution catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions bethinking itit may bea larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing prow smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam  Ahab staggered his hand smote his forehead  I grow blind hands stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way  Ist night  The whale  The ship cried the cringing oarsmen  Oars oars  Slope downwards to thy depths O sea that ere it be for ever too late Ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark  I see the ship the ship  Dash on my men  Will ye not save my ship  But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledgehammering seas the before whalesmitten bowends of two planks burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves its halfwading splashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water  Meantime for that one beholding instant Tashtegos masthead hammer remained suspended in his hand and the red flag halfwrapping him as with a plaid then streamed itself straight out from him as his own forwardflowing heart while Starbuck and Stubb standing upon the bowsprit beneath caught sight of the downcoming monster just as soon as he  The whale the whale  Up helm up helm  Oh all ye sweet powers of air now hug me close  Let not Starbuck die if die he must in a womans fainting fit  Up helm I sayye fools the jaw the jaw Is this the end of all my bursting prayers all my lifelong fidelities  Oh Ahab Ahab lo thy work  Steady helmsman steady Nay nay  Up helm again  He turns to meet us  Oh his unappeasable brow drives on towards one whose duty tells him he cannot depart  My God stand by me now  Stand not by me but stand under me whoever you are that will now help Stubb for Stubb too sticks here  I grin at thee thou grinning whale  Who ever helped Stubb or kept Stubb awake but Stubbs own unwinking eye  And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft would it were stuffed with brushwood I grin at thee thou grinning whale  Look ye sun moon and stars I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost For all that I would yet ring glasses with ye would ye but hand the cup  Oh oh oh oh thou grinning whale but therell be plenty of gulping soon  Why fly ye not O Ahab  For me off shoes and jacket to it let Stubb die in his drawers  A most mouldy and over salted death thoughcherries cherries cherries  Oh Flask for one red cherry ere we die  Cherries  I only wish that we were where they grow  Oh Stubb I hope my poor mothers drawn my partpay ere this if not few coppers will now come to her for the voyage is up  From the ships bows nearly all the seamen now hung inactive hammers bits of plank lances and harpoons mechanically retained in their hands just as they had darted from their various employments all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed  Retribution swift vengeance eternal malice were in his whole aspect and spite of all that mortal man could do the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ships starboard bow till men and timbers reeled  Some fell flat upon their faces  Like dislodged trucks the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bulllike necks  Through the breach they heard the waters pour as mountain torrents down a flume  The ship  The hearsethe second hearse cried Ahab from the boat its wood could only be American  Diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far off the other bow but within a few yards of Ahabs boat where for a time he lay quiescent  I turn my body from the sun  What ho Tashtego let me hear thy hammer  Oh ye three unsurrendered spires of mine thou uncracked keel and only godbullied hull thou firm deck and haughty helm and Polepointed prowdeathglorious ship must ye then perish and without me  Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains  Oh lonely death on lonely life  Oh now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief  Ho ho from all your furthest bounds pour ye now in ye bold billows of my whole foregone life and top this one piled comber of my death  Towards thee I roll thou alldestroying but unconquering whale to the last I grapple with thee from hells heart I stab at thee for hates sake I spit my last breath at thee  Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool and since neither can be mine let me then tow to pieces while still chasing thee though tied to thee thou damned whale  THUS I give up the spear  The harpoon was darted the stricken whale flew forward with igniting velocity the line ran through the groovesran foul  Ahab stooped to clear it he did clear it but the flying turn caught him round the neck and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim he was shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he was gone Next instant the heavy eyesplice in the ropes final end flew out of the starkempty tub knocked down an oarsman and smiting the sea disappeared in its depths  For an instant the tranced boats crew stood still then turned The ship  Great God where is the ship  Soon they through dim bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom as in the gaseous Fata Morgana only the uppermost masts out of water while fixed by infatuation or fidelity or fate to their once lofty perches the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea  And now concentric circles seized the lone boat itself and all its crew and each floating oar and every lancepole and spinning animate and inanimate all round and round in one vortex carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight  But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible together with long streaming yards of the flag which calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroying billows they almost touchedat that instant a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar  A skyhawk that tauntingly had followed the maintruck downwards from its natural home among the stars pecking at the flag and incommoding Tashtego there this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill the submerged savage beneath in his deathgasp kept his hammer frozen there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic shrieks and his imperial beak thrust upwards and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab went down with his ship which like Satan would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her and helmeted herself with it  Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides then all collapsed and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago Epilogue  AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE Job  The dramas done  Why then here does any one step forthBecause one did survive the wreck  It so chanced that after the Parsees disappearance I was he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahabs bowsman when that bowsman assumed the vacant post the same who when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat was dropped astern  So floating on the margin of the ensuing scene and in full sight of it when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me I was then but slowly drawn towards the closing vortex  When I reached it it had subsided to a creamy pool  Round and round then and ever contracting towards the buttonlike black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle like another Ixion I did revolve Till gaining that vital centre the black bubble upward burst and now liberated by reason of its cunning spring and owing to its great buoyancy rising with great force the coffin lifebuoy shot lengthwise from the sea fell over and floated by my side  Buoyed up by that coffin for almost one whole day and night I floated on a soft and dirgelike main  The unharming sharks they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths the savage seahawks sailed with sheathed beaks  On the second day a sail drew near nearer and picked me up at last  It was the deviouscruising Rachel that in her retracing search after her missing children only found
